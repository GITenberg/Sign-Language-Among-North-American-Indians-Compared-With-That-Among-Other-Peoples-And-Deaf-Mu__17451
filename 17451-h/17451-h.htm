<h2>INTRODUCTORY.</h2>

<p>During the past two years the present writer has devoted the intervals
between official duties to collecting and collating materials for the
study of sign language. As the few publications on the general subject,
possessing more than historic interest, are meager in details and vague
in expression, original investigation has been necessary. The high
development of communication by gesture among the tribes of North
America, and its continued extensive use by many of them, naturally
directed the first researches to that continent, with the result that a
large body of facts procured from collaborators and by personal examination
has now been gathered and classified. A correspondence has also been
established with many persons in other parts of the world whose character
and situation rendered it probable that they would contribute valuable
information. The success of that correspondence has been as great as
could have been expected, considering that most of the persons addressed
were at distant points sometimes not easily accessible by mail. As the
collection of facts is still successfully proceeding, not only with
reference to foreign peoples and to deaf-mutes everywhere, but also among
some American tribes not yet thoroughly examined in this respect, no
exposition of the subject pretending to be complete can yet be made.
In complying, therefore, with the request to prepare the present paper,
it is necessary to explain to correspondents and collaborators whom it
may reach, that this is not the comprehensive publication by the Bureau
of Ethnology for which their assistance has been solicited. With this
explanation some of those who have already forwarded contributions
will not be surprised at their omission, and others will not desist from
the work in which they are still kindly engaged, under the impression
that its results will not be received in time to meet with welcome and
credit. On the contrary, the urgent appeal for aid before addressed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg 270]</span>
officers of the Army and Navy of this and other nations, to missionaries,
travelers, teachers of deaf-mutes, and philologists generally, is now with
equal urgency repeated. It is, indeed, hoped that the continued
presentation
of the subject to persons either having opportunity for observation
or the power to favor with suggestions may, by awakening some
additional interest in it, secure new collaboration from localities still
unrepresented.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood by other readers that, as the limits
assigned to this paper permit the insertion of but a small part of the
material already collected and of the notes of study made upon that
accumulation,
it can only show the general scope of the work undertaken,
and not its accomplishment. Such extracts from the collection have
been selected as were regarded as most illustrative, and they are preceded
by a discussion perhaps sufficient to be suggestive, though by no
means exhaustive, and designed to be for popular, rather than for
scientific
use. In short, the direction to submit a progress-report and not a
monograph has been complied with.</p>




<h2>DIVISIONS OF GESTURE SPEECH.</h2>

<p>These are corporeal motion and facial expression. An attempt has
been made by some writers to discuss these general divisions separately,
and its success would be practically convenient if it were always
understood that their connection is so intimate that they can never be
altogether severed. A play of feature, whether instinctive or voluntary,
accentuates and qualifies all motions intended to serve as signs, and
strong instinctive facial expression is generally accompanied by action
of the body or some of its members. But, so far as a distinction can
be made, expressions of the features are the result of emotional, and
corporeal gestures, of intellectual action. The former in general and
the small number of the latter that are distinctively emotional are
nearly identical among men from physiological causes which do not affect
with the same similarity the processes of thought. The large number
of corporeal gestures expressing intellectual operations require and admit
of more variety and conventionality. Thus the features and the
body among all mankind act almost uniformly in exhibiting fear, grief,
surprise, and shame, but all objective conceptions are varied and variously
portrayed. Even such simple indications as those for "no" and
"yes" appear in several differing motions. While, therefore, the terms
sign language and gesture speech necessarily include and suppose facial
expression when emotions are in question, they refer more particularly
to corporeal motions and attitudes. For this reason much of the valuable
contribution of <span class="sc">Darwin</span> in his <i>Expression of the Emotions in Man
and Animals</i> is not directly applicable to sign language. His analysis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg 271]</span>
of emotional gestures into those explained on the principles of serviceable
associated habits, of antithesis, and of the constitution of the nervous
system, should, nevertheless, always be remembered. Even if it
does not strictly embrace the class of gestures which form the subject
of this paper, and which often have an immediate pantomimic origin, the
earliest gestures were doubtless instinctive and generally emotional,
preceding
pictorial, metaphoric, and, still subsequent, conventional gestures
even, as, according to <span class="sc">Darwin</span>'s cogent reasoning, they preceded articulate
speech.</p>

<p>While the distinction above made between the realm of facial play
and that of motions of the body, especially those of the arms and hands,
is sufficiently correct for use in discussion, it must be admitted that the
features do express intellect as well as emotion. The well-known saying
of Charles Lamb that "jokes came in with the candles" is in point, but
the most remarkable example of conveying detailed information without
the use of sounds, hands, or arms, is given by the late President T.H.
Gallaudet, the distinguished instructor of deaf-mutes, which, to be
intelligible, requires to be quoted at length:</p>

<p>"One day, our distinguished and lamented historical painter, Col.
John Trumbull, was in my school-room during the hours of instruction,
and, on my alluding to the tact which the pupil referred to had of reading
my face, he expressed a wish to see it tried. I requested him to select
any event in Greek, Roman, English, or American history of a scenic
character, which would make a striking picture on canvas, and said I
would endeavor to communicate it to the lad. 'Tell him,' said he, 'that
Brutus (Lucius Junius) condemned his two sons to death for resisting his
authority and violating his orders.'</p>

<p>"I folded my arms in front of me, and kept them in that position, to
preclude the possibility of making any signs or gestures, or of spelling
any words on my fingers, and proceeded, as best I could, by the expression
of my countenance, and a few motions of my head and attitudes of
the body, to convey the picture in my own mind to the mind of my pupil.</p>

<p>"It ought to be stated that he was already acquainted with the fact,
being familiar with the leading events in Roman history. But when I
began, he knew not from what portion of history, sacred or profane,
ancient or modern, the fact was selected. From this wide range, my
delineation on the one hand and his ingenuity on the other had to
bring it within the division of Roman history, and, still more minutely,
to the particular individual and transaction designated by Colonel
Trumbull.
In carrying on the process, I made no use whatever of any arbitrary,
conventional look, motion, or attitude, before settled between us,
by which to let him understand what I wished to communicate, with the
exception of a single one, if, indeed, it ought to be considered such.</p>

<p>"The usual sign, at that time, among the teachers and pupils, for a
Roman, was portraying an aquiline nose by placing the forefinger,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg 272]</span>
crooked, in front of the nose. As I was prevented from using my finger
in this way, and having considerable command over the muscles of my
face, I endeavored to give my nose as much of the aquiline form as
possible, and succeeded well enough for my purpose....</p>

<p>"The outlines of the process were the following:</p>

<p>"A stretching and stretching gaze eastward, with an undulating
motion of the head, as if looking across and beyond the Atlantic Ocean,
to denote that the event happened, not on the western, but eastern
continent. This was making a little progress, as it took the subject out
of the range of American history.</p>

<p>"A turning of the eyes upward and backward, with frequently-repeated
motions of the head backward, as if looking a great way back in past
time, to denote that the event was one of ancient date.</p>

<p>"The aquiline shape of the nose, already referred to, indicating that
a Roman was the person concerned. It was, of course, an old Roman.</p>

<p>"Portraying, as well as I could, by my countenance, attitude, and
manner an individual high in authority, and commanding others, as if he
expected to be obeyed.</p>

<p>"Looking and acting as if I were giving out a specific order to many
persons, and threatening punishment on those who should resist my
authority, even the punishment of death.</p>

<p>"Here was a pause in the progress of events, which I denoted by
sleeping as it were during the night and awakening in the morning,
and doing this several times, to signify that several days had elapsed.</p>

<p>"Looking with deep interest and surprise, as if at a single person
brought and standing before me, with an expression of countenance
indicating
that he had violated the order which I had given, and that I
knew it. Then looking in the same way at another person near him as
also guilty. Two offending persons were thus denoted.</p>

<p>"Exhibiting serious deliberation, then hesitation, accompanied with
strong conflicting emotions, producing perturbation, as if I knew not how
to feel or what to do.</p>

<p>"Looking first at one of the persons before me, and then at the other,
and then at both together, <i>as a father would look</i>, indicating his
distressful parental feelings under such afflicting circumstances.</p>

<p>"Composing my feelings, showing that a change was coming over
me, and exhibiting towards the imaginary persons before me the decided
look of the inflexible commander, who was determined and ready to
order them away to execution. Looking and acting as if the tender and
forgiving feelings of <i>the father</i> had again got the ascendency, and
as if I was about to relent and pardon them.</p>

<p>"These alternating states of mind I portrayed several times, to make
my representations the more graphic and impressive.</p>

<p>"At length the father yields, and the stern principle of justice, as
expressed in my countenance and manners, prevails. My look and action
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg 273]</span>
denote the passing of the sentence of death on the offenders, and the
ordering them away to execution.</p>

<hr />

<p>"He quickly turned round to his slate and wrote a correct and complete
account of this story of Brutus and his two sons."</p>

<hr />

<p>While it appears that the expressions of the features are not confined
to the emotions or to distinguishing synonyms, it must be remembered that
the meaning of the same motion of hands, arms, and fingers is often
modified, individualized, or accentuated by associated facial changes
and postures of the body not essential to the sign, which emotional
changes and postures are at once the most difficult to describe and the
most interesting when intelligently reported, not only because they infuse
life into the skeleton sign, but because they may belong to the class
of innate expressions.</p>




<h2>THE ORIGIN OF SIGN LANGUAGE.</h2>

<p>In observing the maxim that nothing can be thoroughly understood unless
its beginning is known, it becomes necessary to examine into the origin
of sign language through its connection with that of oral speech. In
this examination it is essential to be free from the vague popular
impression
that some oral language, of the general character of that now
used among mankind, is "natural" to mankind. It will be admitted on
reflection that all oral languages were at some past time far less
serviceable
to those using them than they are now, and as each particular language
has been thoroughly studied it has become evident that it grew
out of some other and less advanced form. In the investigation of these
old forms it has been so difficult to ascertain how any of them first
became a useful instrument of inter-communication that many conflicting
theories on this subject have been advocated.</p>

<p>Oral language consists of variations and mutations of vocal sounds
produced as signs of thought and emotion. But it is not enough that
those signs should be available as the vehicle of the producer's own
thoughts. They must be also efficient for the communication of such
thoughts to others. It has been, until of late years, generally held that
thought was not possible without oral language, and that, as man was
supposed to have possessed from the first the power of thought, he also
from the first possessed and used oral language substantially as at
present. That the latter, as a special faculty, formed the main distinction
between man and the brutes has been and still is the prevailing
doctrine. In a lecture delivered before the British Association in 1878 it
was declared that "animal intelligence is unable to elaborate that class of
abstract ideas, the formation of which depends upon the faculty of
speech." If instead of "speech" the word "utterance" had been used,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg 274]</span>
as including all possible modes of intelligent communication, the statement
might pass without criticism. But it may be doubted if there is
any more necessary connection between abstract ideas and sounds, the
mere signs of thought, that strike the ear, than there is between the same
ideas and signs addressed only to the eye.</p>

<p>The point most debated for centuries has been, not whether there was
any primitive oral language, but what that language was. Some literalists
have indeed argued from the Mosaic narrative that because the
Creator, by one supernatural act, with the express purpose to form separate
peoples, had divided all tongues into their present varieties, and
could, by another similar exercise of power, obliterate all but one which
should be universal, the fact that he had not exercised that power showed
it not to be his will that any man to whom a particular speech had been
given should hold intercourse with another miraculously set apart from
him by a different speech. By this reasoning, if the study of a foreign
tongue was not impious, it was at least clear that the primitive language
had been taken away as a disciplinary punishment, as the Paradisiac Eden
had been earlier lost, and that, therefore, the search for it was as
fruitless as to attempt the passage of the flaming sword. More liberal Christians
have been disposed to regard the Babel story as allegorical, if not
mythical, and have considered it to represent the disintegration of tongues
out of one which was primitive. In accordance with the advance of
linguistic science they have successively shifted back the postulated
primitive tongue from Hebrew to Sanscrit, then to Aryan, and now seek
to evoke from the vasty deeps of antiquity the ghosts of other rival
claimants for precedence in dissolution. As, however, the languages of
man are now recognized as extremely numerous, and as the very sounds
of which these several languages are composed are so different that the
speakers of some are unable to distinguish with the ear certain sounds in
others, still less able to reproduce them, the search for one common parent
language is more difficult than was supposed by medi&#230;val ignorance.</p>

<p>The discussion is now, however, varied by the suggested possibility
that man at some time may have existed without any oral language.
It is conceded by some writers that mental images or representations
can be formed without any connection with sound, and may at least
serve for thought, though not for expression. It is certain that concepts,
however formed, can be expressed by other means than sound.
One mode of this expression is by gesture, and there is less reason to
believe
that gestures commenced as the interpretation of, or substitute for words
than that the latter originated in, and served to translate gestures. Many
arguments have been advanced to prove that gesture language preceded
articulate speech and formed the earliest attempt at communication,
resulting from the interacting subjective and objective conditions to which
primitive man was exposed. Some of the facts on which deductions have
been based, made in accordance with well-established modes of scientific
research from study of the lower animals, children, idiots, the lower types
of mankind, and deaf-mutes, will be briefly mentioned.</p>

<h3><i>GESTURES OF THE LOWER ANIMALS.</i></h3>

<p>Emotional expression in the features of man is to be considered in
reference to the fact that the special senses either have their seat in, or
are in close relation to the face, and that so large a number of nerves
pass to it from the brain. The same is true of the lower animals, so that
it would be inferred, as is the case, that the faces of those animals are
also expressive of emotion. There is also noticed among them an exhibition
of emotion by corporeal action. This is the class of gestures common
to them with the earliest made by man, as above mentioned, and it
is reasonable to suppose that those were made by man at the time when,
if ever, he was, like the animals, destitute of articulate speech. The
articulate cries uttered by some animals, especially some birds, are
interesting
as connected with the principle of imitation to which languages in
part owe their origin, but in the cases of forced imitation, the mere
acquisition
of a vocal trick, they only serve to illustrate that power of imitation,
and are without significance. Sterne's starling, after his cage had
been opened, would have continued to complain that he could not get out.
If the bird had uttered an instinctive cry of distress when in confinement
and a note of joy on release, there would have been a nearer approach
to language than if it had clearly pronounced many sentences. Such
notes and cries of animals, many of which are connected with reproduction
and nutrition, are well worth more consideration than can now be
given, but regarding them generally it is to be questioned if they are so
expressive as the gestures of the same animals. It is contended that
the bark of a dog is distinguishable into fear, defiance, invitation, and
a note of warning, but it also appears that those notes have been known
only since the animal has been domesticated. The gestures of the dog
are far more readily distinguished than his bark, as in his preparing
for attack, or caressing his master, resenting an injury, begging for food,
or simply soliciting attention. The chief modern use of his tail appears
to be to express his ideas and sensations. But some recent experiments
of Prof. <span class="sc">A. Graham Bell</span>, no less eminent from his work in artificial
speech than in telephones, shows that animals are more physically capable
of pronouncing articulate sounds than has been supposed. He informed
the writer that he recently succeeded by manipulation in causing
an English terrier to form a number of the sounds of our letters, and
particularly brought out from it the words "How are you, Grandmamma?"
with distinctness. This tends to prove that only absence of
brain power has kept animals from acquiring true speech. The remarkable
vocal instrument of the parrot could be used in significance as well
as in imitation, if its brain had been developed beyond the point of
expression by gesture, in which latter the bird is expert.</p>

<p>The gestures of monkeys, whose hands and arms can be used, are nearly
akin to ours. Insects communicate with each other almost entirely by
means of the antenn&#230;. Animals in general which, though not deaf, can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg 276]</span>
not be taught by sound, frequently have been by signs, and probably
all of them understand man's gestures better than his speech. They
exhibit signs to one another with obvious intention, and they also have
often invented them as a means of obtaining their wants from man.</p>



<h3><i>GESTURES OF YOUNG CHILDREN.</i></h3>

<p>The wishes and emotions of very young children are conveyed in a
small number of sounds, but in a great variety of gestures and facial
expressions. A child's gestures are intelligent long in advance of speech;
although very early and persistent attempts are made to give it instruction
in the latter but none in the former, from the time when it begins
<i>risu cognoscere matrem</i>. It learns words only as they are taught, and
learns them through the medium of signs which are not expressly taught.
Long after familiarity with speech, it consults the gestures and facial
expressions of its parents and nurses as if seeking thus to translate or
explain their words. These facts are important in reference to the
biologic law that the order of development of the individual is the same
as that of the species.</p>

<p>Among the instances of gestures common to children throughout the
world is that of protruding the lips, or pouting, when somewhat angry
or sulky. The same gesture is now made by the anthropoid apes and is
found strongly marked in the savage tribes of man. It is noticed by
evolutionists that animals retain during early youth, and subsequently
lose, characters once possessed by their progenitors when adult, and still
retained by distinct species nearly related to them.</p>

<p>The fact is not, however, to be ignored that children invent words as
well as signs with as natural an origin for the one as for the other. An
interesting case was furnished to the writer by Prof. <span class="sc">Bell</span> of an infant
boy who used a combination of sounds given as "nyum-nyum," an evident
onomatope of gustation, to mean "good," and not only in reference to
articles of food relished but as applied to persons of whom the child was
fond, rather in the abstract idea of "niceness" in general. It is a
singular
coincidence that a bright young girl, a friend of the writer, in a letter
describing a juvenile feast, invented the same expression, with nearly the
same spelling, as characteristic of her sensations regarding the delicacies
provided. The Papuans met by Dr. Comrie also called "eating" <i>nam-nam</i>.
But the evidence of all such cases of the voluntary use of articulate
speech by young children is qualified by the fact that it has been
inherited from very many generations, if not quite so long as the faculty
of gesture.</p>



<h3><i>GESTURES IN MENTAL DISORDER.</i></h3>

<p>The insane understand and obey gestures when they have no knowledge
whatever of words. It is also found that semi-idiotic children who
cannot be taught more than the merest rudiments of speech, can receive
a considerable amount of information through signs, and can express
themselves by them. Sufferers from aphasia continue to use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg 277]</span>
appropriate gestures after their words have become uncontrollable. It is
further noticeable in them that mere ejaculations, or sounds which are only
the result of a state of feeling, instead of a desire to express thought,
are generally articulated with accuracy. Patients who have been in
the habit of swearing preserve their fluency in that division of their
vocabulary.</p>



<h3><i>UNINSTRUCTED DEAF-MUTES.</i></h3>

<p>The signs made by congenital and uninstructed deaf-mutes to be now
considered are either strictly natural signs, invented by themselves, or
those of a colloquial character used by such mutes where associated.
The accidental or merely suggestive signs peculiar to families, one member
of which happens to be a mute, are too much affected by the other
members of the family to be of certain value. Those, again, which are
taught in institutions have become conventional and designedly adapted
to translation into oral speech, although founded by the abb&#233; de l'&#201;p&#233;e,
followed by the abb&#233; Sicard, in the natural signs first above mentioned.</p>

<p>A great change has doubtless occurred in the estimation of congenital
deaf-mutes since the Justinian Code, which consigned them forever
to legal infancy, as incapable of intelligence, and classed them with the
insane. Yet most modern writers, for instance Archbishop Whately and
Max M&#252;ller, have declared that deaf-mutes could not think until after
having been instructed. It cannot be denied that the deaf-mute thinks
after his instruction either in the ordinary gesture signs or in the finger
alphabet, or more lately in artificial speech. By this instruction he has
become master of a highly-developed language, such as English or
French, which he can read, write, and actually talk, but that foreign
language he has obtained through the medium of signs. This is a conclusive
proof that signs constitute a real language and one which admits
of thought, for no one can learn a foreign language unless he had
some language of his own, whether by descent or acquisition, by which
it could be translated, and such translation into the new language could
not even be commenced unless the mind had been already in action and
intelligently using the original language for that purpose. In fact the
use by deaf-mutes of signs originating in themselves exhibits a creative
action of mind and innate faculty of expression beyond that of ordinary
speakers who acquired language without conscious effort. The thanks
of students, both of philology and psychology, are due to Prof. <span class="sc">Samuel
Porter</span>, of the National Deaf Mute College, for his response to the
question, "Is thought possible without language?" published in the
<i>Princeton Review</i> for January, 1880.</p>

<p>With regard to the sounds uttered by deaf-mutes, the same explanation
of heredity may be made as above, regarding the words invented
by young children. Congenital deaf-mutes at first make the same
sounds as hearing children of the same age, and, often being susceptible
to vibrations of the air, are not suspected of being deaf. When that
affliction is ascertained to exist, all oral utterances from the deaf-mute
are habitually repressed by the parents.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg 278]</span>



<h3><i>GESTURES OF THE BLIND.</i></h3>

<p>The facial expressions and gestures of the congenitally blind are
worthy of attention. The most interesting and conclusive examples
come from the case of Laura Bridgman, who, being also deaf, could not
possibly have derived them by imitation. When a letter from a beloved
friend was communicated to her by gesture-language, she laughed and
clapped her hands. A roguish expression was given to her face, concomitant
with the emotion, by her holding the lower lip by the teeth.
She blushed, shrugged her shoulders, turned in her elbows, and raised
her eye-brows under the same circumstances as other people. In amazement,
she rounded and protruded the lips, opened them, and breathed
strongly. It is remarkable that she constantly accompanied her "yes"
with the common affirmative nod, and her "no" with our negative shake
of the head, as these gestures are by no means universal and do not
seem clearly connected with emotion. This, possibly, may be explained
by the fact that her ancestors for many generations had used
these gestures. A similar curious instance is mentioned by Cardinal
Wiseman (<i>Essays</i>, III, 547, <i>London</i>, 1853) of an Italian blind
man, the
appearance of whose eyes indicated that he had never enjoyed sight,
and who yet made the same elaborate gestures made by the people with
whom he lived, but which had been used by them immemorially, as
correctly as if he had learned them by observation.</p>



<h3><i>LOSS OF SPEECH BY ISOLATION.</i></h3>

<p>When human beings have been long in solitary confinement, been
abandoned, or otherwise have become isolated from their fellows, they
have lost speech either partially or entirely, and required to have it
renewed
through gestures. There are also several recorded cases of children,
born with all their faculties, who, after having been lost or abandoned,
have been afterwards found to have grown up possessed of acute hearing,
but without anything like human speech. One of these was
Peter, "the Wild Boy," who was found in the woods of Hanover in
1726, and taken to England, where vain attempts were made to teach
him language, though he lived to the age of seventy. Another was a
boy of twelve, found in the forest of Aveyron, in France, about the
beginning
of this century, who was destitute of speech, and all efforts to
teach him failed. Some of these cases are to be considered in connection
with the general law of evolution, that in degeneration the last and
highest acquirements are lost first. When in these the effort at acquiring
or re-acquiring speech has been successful, it has been through gestures,
in the same manner as missionaries, explorers, and shipwrecked
mariners have become acquainted with tongues before unknown to themselves
and sometimes to civilization. All persons in such circumstances
are obliged to proceed by pointing to objects and making gesticulations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg 279]</span>
at the same time observing what articulate sounds were associated with
those motions by the persons addressed, and thus vocabularies and lists of
phrases were formed.</p>



<h3><i>LOW TRIBES OF MAN.</i></h3>

<p>Apart from the establishment of a systematic language of signs under
special circumstances which have occasioned its development, the gestures
of the lower tribes of men may be generally classed under the emotional or
instinctive division, which can be correlated with those of the lower
animals. This may be illustrated by the modes adopted to show friendship
in salutation, taking the place of our shaking hands. Some Pacific
Islanders used to show their joy at meeting friends by sniffing at them,
after the style of well-disposed dogs. The Fuegians pat and slap each
other, and some Polynesians stroke their own faces with the hand or foot of
the friend. The practice of rubbing or pressing noses is very common. It
has been noticed in the Lapland Alps, often in Africa, and in Australia the
tips of the noses are pressed a long time, accompanied
with grunts of satisfaction. Patting and stroking different parts of the
body are still more frequent, and prevailed among the North American
Indians, though with the latter the most common expression was hugging. In
general, the civilities exchanged are similar to those of many animals.</p>



<h3><i>GESTURES AS AN OCCASIONAL RESOURCE.</i></h3>

<p>Persons of limited vocabulary, whether foreigners to the tongue employed or
native, but not accomplished in its use, even in the midst of a
civilization where gestures are deprecated, when at fault for words resort
instinctively to physical motions that are not wild nor meaningless, but
picturesque and significant, though perhaps made by the gesturer for the
first time. An
uneducated laborer, if good-natured enough to be really desirous of
responding to a request for information, when he has exhausted his scanty
stock of words will eke them out by original gestures. While fully
admitting the advice to Coriolanus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant</p>
<p>More learned than the ears&mdash;</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>it may be paraphrased to read that the hands of the ignorant are more
learned than their tongues. A stammerer, too, works his arms and features
as if determined to get his thoughts out, in a manner not only suggestive
of the physical struggle, but of the use of gestures as a hereditary
expedient.</p>



<h3><i>GESTURES OF FLUENT TALKERS.</i></h3>

<p>The same is true of the most fluent talkers on occasions when the exact
vocal formula desired does not at once suggest itself, or is unsatisfactory
without assistance from the physical machinery not embraced in the oral
apparatus. The command of a copious vocabulary common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg 280]</span>
to both speaker and hearer undoubtedly tends to a phlegmatic delivery
and disdain of subsidiary aid. An excited speaker will, however, generally
make a free use of his hands without regard to any effect of that use
upon auditors. Even among the gesture-hating English, when they are
aroused from torpidity of manner, the hands are involuntarily clapped
in approbation, rubbed with delight, wrung in distress, raised in
astonishment,
and waved in triumph. The fingers are snapped for contempt,
the forefinger is vibrated to reprove or threaten, and the fist shaken in
defiance. The brow is contracted with displeasure, and the eyes winked
to show connivance. The shoulders are shrugged to express disbelief
or repugnance, the eyebrows elevated with surprise, the lips bitten in
vexation and thrust out in sullenness or displeasure, while a higher degree
of anger is shown by a stamp of the foot. Quintilian, regarding
the subject, however, not as involuntary exhibition of feeling and
intellect,
but for illustration and enforcement, becomes eloquent on the variety
of motions of which the hands alone are capable, as follows:</p>

<p>"The action of the other parts of the body assists the speaker, but
the hands (I could almost say) speak themselves. By them do we not
demand, promise, call, dismiss, threaten, supplicate, express abhorrence
and terror, question and deny? Do we not by them express joy and
sorrow, doubt, confession, repentance, measure, quantity, number, and
time? Do they not also encourage, supplicate, restrain, convict, admire,
respect? and in pointing out places and persons do they not discharge
the office of adverbs and of pronouns?"</p>

<p>Voss adopts almost the words of Quintilian, "<i>Manus non modo loquentem
adjuvant, sed ips&#230; pene loqui videntur</i>," while Cresollius calls the
hand "the minister of reason and wisdom ... without it there is
no eloquence."</p>



<h3><i>INVOLUNTARY RESPONSE TO GESTURES.</i></h3>

<p>Further evidence of the unconscious survival of gesture language is
afforded by the ready and involuntary response made in signs to signs
when a man with the speech and habits of civilization is brought into
close contact with Indians or deaf-mutes. Without having ever before
seen or made one of their signs, he will soon not only catch the meaning
of theirs, but produce his own, which they will likewise comprehend,
the power seemingly remaining latent in him until called forth by
necessity.</p>



<h3><i>NATURAL PANTOMIME.</i></h3>

<p>In the earliest part of man's history the subjects of his discourse must
have been almost wholly sensuous, and therefore readily expressed in
pantomime.
Not only was pantomime sufficient for all the actual needs of
his existence, but it is not easy to imagine how he could have used
language
such as is now known to us. If the best English dictionary and
grammar had been miraculously furnished to him, together with the art
of reading with proper pronunciation, the gift would have been valueless,
because the ideas expressed by the words had not yet been formed.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg 281]</span>

<p>That the early concepts were of a direct and material character is
shown by what has been ascertained of the roots of language, and there
does not appear to be much difficulty in expressing by other than vocal
instrumentality all that could have been expressed by those roots.
Even now, with our vastly increased belongings of external life,
avocations,
and habits, nearly all that is absolutely necessary for our physical
needs can be expressed in pantomime. Far beyond the mere signs for
eating, drinking, sleeping, and the like, any one will understand a
skillful
representation in signs of a tailor, shoemaker, blacksmith, weaver,
sailor, farmer, or doctor. So of washing, dressing, shaving, walking,
driving, writing, reading, churning, milking, boiling, roasting or frying,
making bread or preparing coffee, shooting, fishing, rowing, sailing,
sawing, planing, boring, and, in short, an endless list.</p>

<p>Max M&#252;ller properly calls touch, scent, and taste the palaioteric, and
sight and hearing the neoteric senses, the latter of which often require
to be verified by the former. Touch is the lowest in specialization and
development, and is considered to be the oldest of the senses, the others
indeed being held by some writers to be only its modifications. Scent, of
essential importance to many animals, has with man almost ceased to be
of any, except in connection with taste, which he has developed to a high
degree. Whether or not sight preceded hearing in order of development,
it is difficult, in conjecturing the first attempts of man or his
hypothetical
ancestor at the expression either of percepts or concepts, to connect
vocal sounds with any large number of objects, but it is readily
conceivable
that the characteristics of their forms and movements should have
been suggested to the eye&mdash;fully exercised before the tongue&mdash;so soon
as the arms and fingers became free for the requisite simulation or
portrayal.
There is little distinction between pantomime and a developed
sign language, in which thought is transmitted rapidly and certainly
from hand to eye as it is in oral speech from lips to ear; the former is,
however, the parent of the latter, which is more abbreviated and less
obvious. Pantomime acts movements, reproduces forms and positions,
presents pictures, and manifests emotions with greater realization than
any other mode of utterance. It may readily be supposed that a troglodyte
man would desire to communicate the finding of a cave in the
vicinity of a pure pool, circled with soft grass, and shaded by trees
bearing
edible fruit. No sound of nature is connected with any of those
objects, but the position and size of the cave, its distance and direction,
the water, its quality, and amount, the verdant circling carpet, and the
kind and height of the trees could have been made known by pantomime
in the days of the mammoth, if articulate speech had not then been
established,
as Indians or deaf-mutes now communicate similar information
by the same agency.</p>

<p>The proof of this fact, as regards deaf-mutes, will hardly be demanded,
as their expressive pantomime has been so often witnessed. That of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg 282]</span>
the North American Indians, as distinct from the signs which are generally
its abbreviations, has been frequently described in general terms,
but it may be interesting to present two instances from remote localities.</p>

<p>A Maricopa Indian, in the present limits of Arizona, was offered an
advantageous trade for his horse, whereupon he stretched himself on
his horse's neck, caressed it tenderly, at the same time shutting his
eyes, meaning thereby that no offer could tempt him to part with his
charger.</p>

<p>An A-tco-m&#226;-wi or Pit River Indian, in Northeastern California, to
explain the cause of his cheeks and forehead being covered with tar,
represented
a man falling, and, despite his efforts to save him, trembling,
growing pale (pointing from his face to that of a white man), and sinking
to sleep, his spirit winging its way to the skies, which he indicated by
imitating with his hands the flight of a bird upwards, his body sleeping
still upon the river bank, to which he pointed. The tar upon his face
was thus shown to be his dress of mourning for a friend who had fallen
and died.</p>

<p>Several descriptions of pure pantomime, intermixed with the more
conventionalized signs, will be found in the present paper. In especial,
reference is made to the Address of Kin Ch&#275;-&#277;ss, N&#225;tci's
Narrative, the Dialogue between Alaskan Indians, and Na-wa-gi-jig's Story.</p>




<h2>SOME THEORIES UPON PRIMITIVE LANGUAGE.</h2>

<p>Cresollius, writing in 1620, was strongly in favor of giving precedence
to gesture. He says, "Man, full of wisdom and divinity, could have
appeared nothing superior to a naked trunk or block had he not been
adorned with the hand as the interpreter and messenger of his thoughts."
He quotes with approval the brother of St. Basil in declaring that had
men been formed without hands they would never have been endowed
with an articulate voice, and concludes: "Since, then, nature has furnished
us with two instruments for the purpose of bringing into light
and expressing the silent affections of the mind, language and the hand,
it has been the opinion of learned and intelligent men that the former
would be maimed and nearly useless without the latter; whereas the
hand, without the aid of language, has produced many and wonderful effects."</p>

<p>Rabelais, who incorporated into his satirical work much true learning
and philosophy, makes his hero announce the following opinion:</p>

<p>"Nothing less, quoth Pantagruel [Book iii, ch. xix], do I believe
than that it is a mere abusing of our understandings to give credit to
the words of those who say that there is any such thing as a natural
language. All speeches have had their primary origin from the arbitrary
institutions, accords, and agreements of nations in their respective
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg 283]</span>
condescendments to what should be noted and betokened by them. An articulate
voice, according to the dialecticians, hath naturally no signification
at all; for that the sense and meaning thereof did totally depend
upon the good will and pleasure of the first deviser and imposer of it."</p>

<p>Max M&#252;ller, following Professor Heyse, of Berlin, published an ingenious
theory of primitive speech, to the effect that man had a creative
faculty giving to each conception, as it thrilled through his brain for the
first time, a special phonetic expression, which faculty became extinct
when its necessity ceased. This theory, which makes each radical of
language to be a phonetic type rung out from the organism of the first
man or men when struck by an idea, has been happily named the "ding-dong"
theory. It has been abandoned mainly through the destructive
criticisms of Prof. <span class="sc">W.D. Whitney</span>, of Yale College. One lucid explanation
by the latter should be specially noted: "A word is a combination
of sounds which by a series of historical reasons has come to be accepted
and understood in a certain community as the sign of a certain
idea. As long as they so accept and understand it, it has existence;
when everyone ceases to use and understand it, it ceases to exist."</p>

<p>Several authors, among them Kaltschmidt, contend that there was but
one primitive language, which was purely onomatop&oelig;ic, that is, imitative
of natural sounds. This has been stigmatized as the "bow-wow"
theory, but its advocates might derive an argument from the epithet
itself, as not only our children, but the natives of Papua, call the dog a
"bow-wow." They have, however, gone too far in attempting to trace
back words in their shape as now existing to any natural sounds instead
of confining that work to the roots from which the words have sprung.</p>

<p>Another attempt has been made, represented by Professor Noir&#233;,
to account for language by means of interjectional cries. This Max
M&#252;ller revengefully styled the "pooh-pooh" theory. In it is included
the rhythmical sounds which a body of men make seemingly by a common
impulse when engaged in a common work, such as the cries of
sailors when hauling on a rope or pulling an oar, or the yell of savages
in an attack. It also derives an argument from the impulse of life by
which the child shouts and the bird sings. There are, however, very few
either words or roots of words which can be proved to have that derivation.</p>

<p>Professor <span class="sc">Sayce</span>, in his late work, <i>Introduction to the Science of
Language, London</i>, 1880, gives the origin of language in gestures, in
onomatop&oelig;ia, and to a limited extent in interjectional cries. He concludes
it to be the ordinary theory of modern comparative philologists that all
languages are traced back to a certain number of abstract roots, each of
which was a sort of sentence in embryo, and while he does not admit
this as usually presented, he believes that there was a time in the history
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg 284]</span>
of speech, when the articulate or semi-articulate sounds uttered by
primitive men were made the significant representations of thought by the
gestures with which they were accompanied. This statement is specially
gratifying to the present writer as he had advanced much the same
views in his first publication on the subject in the following paragraph,
now reproduced with greater confidence:</p>

<p>"From their own failures and discordancies, linguistic scholars have
recently decided that both the 'bow-wow' and the 'ding-dong' theories
are unsatisfactory; that the search for imitative, onomatop&oelig;ic, and
directly expressive sounds to explain the origin of human speech has been
too exclusive, and that many primordial roots of language have been
founded in the involuntary sounds accompanying certain actions. As,
however, the action was the essential, and the consequent or concomitant
sound the accident, it would be expected that a representation or
feigned reproduction of the action would have been used to express
the idea before the sound associated with that action could have been
separated from it. The visual onomatop&oelig;ia of gestures, which even
yet have been subjected to but slight artificial corruption, would
therefore serve as a key to the audible. It is also contended that in the
pristine days, when the sounds of the only words yet formed had close
connection with objects and the ideas directly derived from them, signs
were as much more copious for communication than speech, as the sight
embraces more and more distinct characteristics of objects than does the
sense of hearing."</p>



<h3><i>CONCLUSIONS.</i></h3>

<p>The preponderance of authority is in favor of the view that man, when
in the possession of all his faculties, did not choose between voice and
gesture, both being originally instinctive, as they both are now, and
never, with those faculties, was in a state where the one was used to the
absolute exclusion of the other. The long neglected work of Dalgarno,
published in 1661, is now admitted to show wisdom when he says: "<i>non
minus naturale fit homini communicare in</i> Figuris <i>quam</i> Sonis:
<i>quorum
utrumque dico homini</i> naturale." With the voice man at first imitated
the few sounds of nature, while with gesture he exhibited actions, motions,
positions, forms, dimensions, directions, and distances, and their
derivatives. It would appear from this unequal division of capacity
that oral speech remained rudimentary long after gesture had become
an art. With the concession of all purely imitative sounds and of the
spontaneous action of the vocal organs under excitement, it is still true
that the connection between ideas and words generally depended upon
a compact between the speaker and hearer which presupposes the existence
of a prior mode of communication. That was probably by gesture,
which, in the apposite phrase of Professor <span class="sc">Sayce</span>, "like the rope-bridges
of the Himalayas or the Andes, formed the first rude means of
communication between man and man." At the very least it may be

gladly accepted provisionally as a clue leading out of the labyrinth of
philologic confusion.</p>

<p>For the purpose of the present paper there is, however, no need of an
absolute decision upon the priority between communication of ideas by
bodily motion and by vocal articulation. It is enough to admit that the
connection between them was so early and intimate that gestures, in
the wide sense indicated of presenting ideas under physical forms,
had a direct formative effect upon many words; that they exhibit the
earliest condition of the human mind; are traced from the remotest
antiquity among all peoples possessing records; are generally prevalent
in the savage stage of social evolution; survive agreeably in the scenic
pantomime, and still adhere to the ordinary speech of civilized man by
motions of the face, hands, head, and body, often involuntary, often
purposely in illustration or for emphasis.</p>

<p>It may be unnecessary to explain that none of the signs to be described,
even those of present world-wide prevalence, are presented as
precisely those of primitive man. Signs as well as words, animals,
and plants have had their growth, development, and change, their births
and deaths, and their struggle for existence with survival of the fittest.
It is, however, thought probable from reasons hereinafter mentioned that
their radicals can be ascertained with more precision than those of
words.</p>




<h2>HISTORY OF GESTURE LANGUAGE.</h2>

<p>There is ample evidence of record, besides that derived from other
sources, that the systematic use of gesture speech was of great antiquity.
Livy so declares, and Quintilian specifies that the "<i>lex gestus ... ab
illis temporibus heroicis orta est</i>." Plato classed its practice
among
civil virtues, and Chrysippus gave it place among the proper education
of freemen. Athen&#230;us tells that gestures were even reduced to distinct
classification with appropriate terminology. The class suited to comedy
was called Cordax, that to tragedy Eumelia, and that for satire Sicinnis,
from the inventor Sicinnus. Bathyllus from these formed a fourth
class, adapted to pantomime. This system appears to have been particularly
applicable to theatrical performances. Quintilian, later, gave
most elaborate rules for gestures in oratory, which are specially
noticeable
from the importance attached to the manner of disposing the
fingers. He attributed to each particular disposition a significance or
suitableness which are not now obvious. Some of them are retained by
modern orators, but without the same, or indeed any, intentional meaning,
and others are wholly disused.</p>

<p>The value of these digital arrangements is, however, shown by their
use among the modern Italians, to whom they have directly descended.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg 286]</span>
From many illustrations of this fact the following is selected. Fig. 61
is copied from Austin's <i>Chironomia</i> as his graphic execution of the
gesture described by Quintilian: "The fore
finger of the right hand joining the middle
of its nail to the extremity of its own
thumb, and moderately extending the
rest of the fingers, is graceful in <i>approving</i>."
Fig. 62 is taken from De Jorio's
plates and descriptions of the gestures
among modern Neapolitans, with the same idea of approbation&mdash;"good."
Both of these may be compared with Fig. 63, a common sign among the
North American Indians to express affirmation and approbation. With
the knowledge of these details it is possible to
believe the story of Macrobius that Cicero used
to vie with Roscius, the celebrated actor, as to
which of them could express a sentiment in the
greater variety of ways, the one by gesture and
the other by speech, with the apparent result of
victory to the actor who was so satisfied with the
superiority of his art that he wrote a book on the subject.</p>

<p>Gestures were treated of with still more distinction as connected with
pantomimic dances and representations. &#198;schylus appears to have
brought theatrical gesture to a high degree of perfection, but Telestes, a
dancer employed by him, introduced the dumb
show, a dance without marked dancing steps, and
subordinated to motions of the hands, arms, and
body, which is dramatic pantomime. He was so
great an artist, says Athen&#230;us, that when he represented
the <i>Seven before Thebes</i> he rendered every
circumstance manifest by his gestures alone. From
Greece, or rather from Egypt, the art was brought to
Rome, and in the reign of Augustus was the great
delight of that Emperor and his friend M&#230;cenas.
Bathyllus, of Alexandria, was the first to introduce
it to the Roman public, but he had a dangerous rival in Pylades. The latter
was magnificent, pathetic, and affecting, while Bathyllus was gay and
sportive. All Rome was split into factions about their respective merits.
Athen&#230;us speaks of a distinguished performer of his own time (he
died A.D. 194) named Memphis, whom he calls the "dancing philosopher,"
because he showed what the Pythagorean philosophy could do by
exhibiting in silence everything with stronger evidence than they could
who professed to teach the arts of language. In the reign of Nero, a
celebrated
pantomimist who had heard that the cynic philosopher Demetrius
spoke of the art with contempt, prevailed upon him to witness
his performance, with the result that the cynic, more and more astonished,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg 287]</span>
at last cried out aloud, "Man, I not only see, but I hear what you
do, for to me you appear to speak with your hands!"</p>

<p>Lucian, who narrates this in his work <i>De Saltatione</i>, gives another
tribute to the talent of, perhaps, the same performer. A barbarian
prince of Pontus (the story is told elsewhere of Tyridates, King of
Armenia), having come to Rome to do homage to the Emperor Nero,
and been taken to see the pantomimes, was asked on his departure by the
Emperor what present he would have as a mark of his favor. The
barbarian begged that he might have the principal pantomimist, and upon
being asked why he made such an odd request, replied that he had
many neighbors who spoke such various and discordant languages that
he found it difficult to obtain any interpreter who could understand
them or explain his commands; but if he had the dancer he could by
his assistance easily make himself intelligible to all.</p>

<p>While the general effect of these pantomimes is often mentioned,
there remain but few detailed descriptions of them. Apuleius, however,
in the tenth book of his <i>Metamorphosis</i> or "Golden Ass," gives
sufficient
details of the performance of the Judgment of Paris to show that it
strongly resembled the best form of ballet opera known in modern times.
These exhibitions were so greatly in favor that, according to Ammianus
Marcellinus, there were in Rome in the year 190 six thousand persons
devoted
to the art, and that when a famine raged they were all kept in the
city, though besides all the strangers all the philosophers were forced
to leave. Their popularity continued until the sixth century, and it is
evident from a decree of Charlemagne that they were not lost, or at least,
had been revived in his time. Those of us who have enjoyed the performance
of the original Ravel troupe will admit that the art still survives,
though not with the magnificence or perfection, especially with
reference to serious subjects, which it exhibited in the age of imperial
Rome.</p>

<p>Early and prominent among the post-classic works upon gesture is
that of the venerable Bede (who flourished A.D. 672-735) <i>De Loquel&#226;
per Gestum Digitorum, sive de Indigitatione</i>. So much discussion had
indeed been carried on in reference to the use of signs for the desideratum
of a universal mode of communication, which also was designed
to be occult and mystic, that Rabelais, in the beginning of the sixteenth
century, who, however satirical, never spent his force upon matters of
little importance, devotes much attention to it. He makes his English
philosopher, Thaumast "The Wonderful" declare, "I will dispute by
signs only, without speaking, for the matters are so abstruse, hard, and
arduous, that words proceeding from the mouth of man will never be
sufficient for unfolding of them to my liking."</p>

<p>The earliest contributions of practical value connected with the subject
were made by George Dalgarno, of Aberdeen, in two works, one
published in London, 1661, entitled <i>Ars Signorum, vulgo character
universalis et lingua philosophica</i>, and the other printed at Oxford,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg 288]</span>
1680, entitled, <i>Didascalocophus, or the Deaf and Dumb Man's Tutor</i>.
He spent his life in obscurity, and his works, though he was incidentally
mentioned by Leibnitz under the name of "M. Dalgarus," passed into
oblivion. Yet he undoubtedly was the precursor of Bishop Wilkins in
his <i>Essay toward a Real Character and a Philosophical Language</i>,
published in London, 1668, though indeed the first idea was far older, it
having been, as reported by Piso, the wish of Galen that some way
might be found out to represent things by such peculiar signs and names
as should express their natures. Dalgarno's ideas respecting the education
of the dumb were also of the highest value, and though they were too
refined and enlightened to be appreciated at the period when he wrote,
they probably were used by Dr. Wallis if not by Sicard. Some of his
thoughts should be quoted: "As I think the eye to be as docile as the ear;
so neither see I any reason but the hand might be made as tractable an
organ as the tongue; and as soon brought to form, if not fair, at least
legible characters, as the tongue to imitate and echo back articulate
sounds." A paragraph prophetic of the late success in educating blind
deaf-mutes is as follows: "The soul can exert her powers by the ministry
of any of the senses: and, therefore, when she is deprived of her
principal secretaries, the eye and the ear, then she must be contented
with the service of her lackeys and scullions, the other senses; which are
no less true and faithful to their mistress than the eye and the ear; but
not so quick for dispatch."</p>

<p>In his division of the modes of "expressing the inward emotions by
outward and sensible signs" he relegates to physiology cases "when
the internal passions are expressed by such external signs as have a
natural connection, by way of cause and effect, with the passion they
discover, as laughing, weeping, frowning, &amp;c., and this way of
interpretation
being common to the brute with man belongs to natural philosophy.
And because this goes not far enough to serve the rational soul,
therefore, man has invented Sematology." This he divides into Pneumatology,
interpretation by sounds conveyed through the ear; Schematology,
by figures to the eye, and Haptology, by mutual contact, skin
to skin. Schematology is itself divided into Typology or Grammatology,
and Cheirology or Dactylology. The latter embraces "the transient
motions of the fingers, which of all other ways of interpretation comes
nearest to that of the tongue."</p>

<p>As a phase in the practice of gestures in lieu of speech must be mentioned
the code of the Cistercian monks, who were vowed to silence except
in religious exercises. That they might literally observe their vows
they were obliged to invent a system of communication by signs, a list
of which is given by Leibnitz, but does not show much ingenuity.</p>

<p>A curious description of the speech of the early inhabitants of the
world, given by Swedenborg in his <i>Arcana C&oelig;lestia</i>, published
1749-1756,
may be compared with the present exhibitions of deaf-mutes in institutions
for their instruction. He says it was not articulate like the
vocal speech of our time, but was tacit, being produced not by external
respiration, but by internal. They were able to express their meaning
by slight motions of the lips and corresponding changes of the face.</p>

<p>Austin's comprehensive work, <i>Chironomia, or a Treatise on Rhetorical
Delivery, London</i>, 1806, is a repertory of information for all writers
on gesture, who have not always given credit to it, as well as on all
branches of oratory. This has been freely used by the present writer, as
has also the volume by the canon Andrea de Jorio, <i>La Mimica degli
Antichi investigata nel Gestire Napoletano, Napoli</i>, 1832. The canon's
chief object was to interpret the gestures of the ancients as shown in
their works of art and described in their writings, by the modern
gesticulations of the Neapolitans, and he has proved that the general
system
of gesture once prevailing in ancient Italy is substantially the same as
now observed. With an understanding of the existing language of
gesture the scenes on the most ancient Greek vases and reliefs obtain a
new and interesting significance and form a connecting link between the
present and prehistoric times. Two of De Jorio's plates are here
reproduced,
Figs. 64 and 67, with such explanation and further illustration
as is required for the present subject.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/fig64.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig64.png" alt="Group. Old Greek" /></a>Fig. 64.&mdash;Group from an ancient Greek vase.</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg 289]</span>

<p>The spirited figures upon the ancient vase, Fig. 64, are red upon a
black ground and are described in the published account in French of
the collection of Sir John Coghill, Bart., of which the following is a free
translation:</p>

<p>Dionysos or Bacchus is represented with a strong beard, his head girt
with the credemnon, clothed in a long folded tunic, above which is an
ample cloak, and holding a thyrsus. Under the form of a satyr, Comus,
or the genius of the table, plays on the double flute and tries to excite
to the dance two nymphs, the companions of Bacchus&mdash;Galen&#233;, Tranquility,
and Eudia, Serenity. The first of them is dressed in a tunic, above which
is a fawn skin, holding a tympanum or classic drum on which she is
about to strike, while her companion marks the time by a snapping of
the fingers, which custom the author of the catalogue wisely states is
still kept up in Italy in the dance of the tarantella. The composition
is said to express allegorically that pure and serene pleasures are
benefits derived from the god of wine.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:35%;"><a href="images/fig65.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig65.png" alt="Negation. Dakota" /></a>Fig. 65.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/fig66.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig66.png" alt="Love. Modern Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 66.</div>

<p>This is a fair example of the critical acumen of art-commentators.
The gestures of the two nymphs are interesting, but on very slight
examination it appears that those of Galen&#233; have nothing to do with
beat of drum, nor have those of Eudia any connection with music,
though it is not so clear what is the true subject under discussion.
Aided, however, by the light of the modern sign language of Naples,
there seems to be by no means serenity prevailing, but a quarrel between
the ladies, on a special subject which is not necessarily pure. The
nymph at the reader's left fixes her eyes upon her companion with her
index in the same direction, clearly indicating, <i>thou.</i> That the
address
is reproachful is shown from her countenance, but with greater certainty
from her attitude and the corresponding one of her companion, who raises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg 290]</span>
both her hands in surprise accompanied with negation. The latter is
expressed
by the right hand raised toward the shoulder, with the palm opposed
to the person to whom response is made. This is the rejection of the
idea presented, and is expressed by some of our Indians, as shown in Fig.
65. A sign of the Dakota tribe of Indians with the same signification is given
in Fig. 270, page <a href="#page441">441</a>, <i>infra</i>. At the same
time the upper part of the nymph's body is
drawn backward as far as the preservation of
equilibrium permits. So a reproach or accusation
is made on the one part, and denied,
whether truthfully or not, on the other. Its
subject also may be ascertained. The left
hand of Eudia is not mute; it is held towards
her rival with the balls of the index and
thumb united, the modern Neapolitan sign for <i>love</i>, which is drawn
more clearly in Fig. 66. It is called the kissing of the thumb and finger, and
there is ample authority to show that among the ancient classics it was
a sign of marriage. St. Jerome, quoted by Vincenzo Requena, says:
"<i>Nam et ipsa digitorum conjunctio, et quasi molli
osculo se complectans et f&oelig;derans, maritum pingit
et conjugem</i>;" and Apuleius clearly alludes to
the same gesture as used in the adoration of Venus,
by the words "<i>primore digito in erectum pollicem
residente</i>." The gesture is one of the few
out of the large number described in various parts
of Rabelais' great work, the significance of which
is explained. It is made by Naz-de-cabre or Goat's
Nose (<i>Pantagruel</i>, Book III, Ch. XX), who lifted
up into the air his left hand, the whole fingers
whereof he retained fistways closed together, except the thumb and the
forefinger, whose nails he softly joined and coupled to one another.
"I understand, quoth Pantagruel, what he meaneth by that sign. It
denotes marriage." The quarrel is thus established to be about love;
and the fluting satyr seated between the two nymphs, behind whose back
the accusation is furtively made by the jealous one, may well be the object
concerning whom jealousy is manifested. Eudia therefore, instead of
"serenely" marking time for a "tranquil" tympanist, appears to be crying,
"Galen&#233;! you bad thing! you are having, or trying to have, an affair
with my Comus!"&mdash;an accusation which this writer verily believes to
have been just. The lady's attitude in affectation of surprised denial is
not that of injured innocence.</p>

<p>Fig. 67, taken from a vase in the Homeric Gallery, is rich in natural
gestures. Without them, from the costumes and attitudes it is easy to
recognize the protagonist or principal actor in the group, and its general
subject. The warrior goddess Athen&#233; stands forth in the midst of what
appears to be a council of war. After the study of modern gesture
speech, the votes of each member of the council, with the degree of
positiveness
or interest felt by each, can be ascertained. Athen&#233; in animated
motion turns her eyes to the right, and extends her left arm and
hand to the left, with her right hand brandishing a lance in the same
direction, in which her feet show her to be ready to spring. She is urging
the figures on her right to follow her at once to attempt
some dangerous enterprise. Of these the elderly man, who is calmly seated,
holds his right hand flat and reversed, and suspended slightly above his
knee.
This probably is the ending of the modern Neapolitan gesture, Fig. 68,
which signifies hesitation, advice to pause
before hasty action, "go slowly," and commences higher with a
gentle wavering movement downward. This can be compared with
the sign of some of our Indians, Fig. 69, for <i>wait! slowly!</i> The
female figure at the left of the group, standing firmly and decidedly,
raises her left hand directed to the goddess with the palm vertical. If
this is supposed to be a stationary gesture it means, "<i>wait! stop!</i>"
It may, however,
be the commencement of the last mentioned gesture, "<i>go slow</i>."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:38%;"><a href="images/fig70.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig70.png" alt="Question, asking. Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 70.</div>

<p>Both of these members of the council advise delay and express doubt of the
propriety of immediate action.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:53%;"><a href="images/fig71.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig71.png" alt="Tell me. N.A. Indian" /></a>Fig. 71.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width:27%;"><a href="images/fig72.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig72.png" alt="Interrogation. Australian" /></a>Fig. 72.</div>

<p>The sitting warrior on the left of Athen&#233; presents his left hand flat
and carried well up. This position, supposed to be stationary, now
means to <i>ask, inquire</i>, and it may be that he inquires of the other
veteran what reasons he can produce
for his temporizing policy. This may be collated with the modern Neapolitan
sign for <i>ask</i>, Fig. 70, and the common Indian sign for "<i>tell
me!</i>" Fig. 71. In connection
with this it is also interesting to compare the Australian sign for
interrogation, Fig. 72, and also the Comanche Indian sign for <i>give
me</i>, Fig. 301, page <a href="#page480">480</a>, <i>infra</i>. If, however, the artist had
the intention to represent the flat hand as in motion
from below upward, as is probable from the connection,
the meaning is <i>much, greatly</i>. He strongly disapproves
the counsel of the opposite side. Our Indians
often express the idea of quantity, <i>much</i>, with
the same conception of comparative height, by an upward motion of
the extended palm, but with them the palm is held downward. The
last figure to the right, by the action of his whole body, shows his rejection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg 292]</span>
of the proposed delay, and his right hand gives the modern sign of
combined surprise and reproof.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:52%;"><a href="images/fig73.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig73.png" alt="Pulcinella" /></a>Fig. 73.</div>

<p>It is interesting to note the similarity of the merely emotional gestures
and attitudes of modern Italy with those of the classics. The Pulcinella,
Fig. 73, for instance, drawn from life in the streets of Naples, has the
same pliancy and <i>abandon</i> of the limbs as appears in the supposed
foolish slaves of the Vatican Terence.</p>

<p>In close connection with this branch of the study reference must be made
to the gestures exhibited in the works of Italian art only modern
in comparison with the high antiquity of their predecessors. A
good instance is in the Last Supper of Leonardo da Vinci, painted
toward the close of the fifteenth century, and to the figure of Judas
as there portrayed. The gospel denounces him as a thief, which
is expressed in the painting by the hand extended and slightly
curved; imitative of the pilferer's act in clutching and drawing toward
him furtively the stolen object, and is the same gesture that
now indicates <i>theft</i> in Naples, Fig. 74, and among some of the North
American Indians, Fig. 75. The pictorial propriety of the sign is
preserved by the apparent desire of the traitor to obtain the one
white loaf of bread on the table
(the remainder being of coarser quality) which lies near where his hand
is tending. Raffaelle was equally particular in his exhibition of gesture
language, even unto the minutest detail of the
arrangement of the fingers. It is traditional
that he sketched the Madonna's hands for the
Spasimo di Sicilia in eleven different positions before he was satisfied.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:33%;"><a href="images/fig74.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig74.png" alt="Thief. Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 74.</div>

<p>No allusion to the bibliography of gesture
speech, however slight, should close without
including the works of Mgr. D. De Haerne, who
has, as a member of the Belgian Chamber of
Representatives, in addition to his rank in the Roman Catholic Church,
been active in promoting the cause of education in general, and especially
that of the deaf and dumb. His admirable treatise <i>The Natural
Language of Signs</i> has been translated and is accessible to American
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg 293]</span>
readers in the <i>American Annals of the Deaf and Dumb</i>, 1875. In that
valuable serial, conducted by Prof. <span class="sc">E.A. Fay</span>, of the National Deaf
Mute College at Washington, and now in its twenty-sixth volume, a
large amount of the current literature on the subject indicated by its
title can be found.</p>

<h2>MODERN USE OF GESTURE SPEECH.</h2>

<p>Dr. <span class="sc">Tylor</span> says (<i>Early History of Mankind</i>, 44): "We cannot lay down
as a rule that gesticulation decreases as civilization advances, and say,
for instance, that a Southern Frenchman, because his talk is illustrated
with gestures as a book with pictures, is less civilized than a German
or Englishman." This is true, and yet it is almost impossible for persons
not accustomed to gestures to observe them without associating
the idea of low culture. Thus in Mr. Darwin's summing up of those
characteristics of the natives of Tierra del Fuego, which rendered it
difficult to believe them to be fellow-creatures, he classes their "violent
gestures" with their filthy and greasy skins, discordant voices, and
hideous faces bedaubed with paint. This description is quoted by the Duke
of Argyle in his <i>Unity of Nature</i> in approval of those
characteristics as evidence, of the lowest condition of humanity.</p>

<p>Whether or not the power of the visible gesture relative to, and its
influence upon the words of modern oral speech are in inverse proportion
to the general culture, it seems established that they do not bear that or
any constant proportion to the development of the several languages
with which gesture is still more or less associated. The statement has
frequently been made that gesture is yet to some highly-advanced languages
a necessary modifying factor, and that only when a language has
become so artificial as to be completely expressible in written
signs&mdash;indeed,
has been remodeled through their long familiar use&mdash;can the bodily
signs be wholly dispensed with. The evidence for this statement is now
doubted, and it is safer to affirm that a common use of gesture depends
more upon the sociologic conditions of the speakers than upon the degree
of copiousness of their oral speech.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg 294]</span>



<h3><i>USE BY OTHER PEOPLES THAN NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS.</i></h3>

<p>The nearest approach to a general rule which it is now proposed to
hazard is that where people speaking precisely the same dialect are
not numerous, and are thrown into constant contact on equal terms
with others of differing dialects and languages, gesture is necessarily
resorted to for converse with the latter, and remains for an indefinite
time
as a habit or accomplishment among themselves, while large bodies enjoying
common speech, and either isolated from foreigners, or, when in contact
with them, so dominant as to compel the learning and adoption of
their own tongue, become impassive in its delivery. The ungesturing
English, long insular, and now rulers when spread over continents, may
be compared with the profusely gesticulating Italians dwelling in a maze
of dialects and subject for centuries either to foreign rule or to the
influx
of strangers on whom they depended. So common is the use of
gestures in Italy, especially among the lower and uneducated classes,
that utterance without them seems to be nearly impossible. The driver
or boatman will often, on being addressed, involuntarily drop the reins
or oars, at the risk of a serious accident, to respond with his arms and
fingers in accompaniment of his tongue. Nor is the habit confined to
the uneducated. King Ferdinand returning to Naples after the revolt
of 1821, and finding that the boisterous multitude would not allow his
voice to be heard, resorted successfully to a royal address in signs,
giving
reproaches, threats, admonitions, pardon, and dismissal, to the entire
satisfaction of the assembled lazzaroni. The medium, though probably
not the precise manner of its employment, recalls Lucan's account of
the quieting of an older tumult&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i10">tumultum</p>
<p>Composuit vultu, dextraque silentia fecit.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>This rivalry of Punch would, in London, have occasioned measureless
ridicule and disgust. The difference in what is vaguely styled temperament
does not wholly explain the contrast between the two peoples, for
the performance was creditable both to the readiness of the King in an
emergency and to the aptness of his people, the main distinction being
that in Italy there was in 1821, and still is, a recognized and cultivated
language of signs long disused in Great Britain. In seeking to account
for this it will be remembered that the Italians have a more direct descent
from the people who, as has been above shown, in classic times so long and
lovingly cultivated gesture as a system. They have also had more generally
before their eyes the artistic relics in which gestures have been preserved.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that some English writers, notably Addison
(<i>Spectator</i>,
407), have contended that it does not suit the genius of that nation
to use gestures even in public speaking, against which doctrine Austin
vigorously remonstrates. He says: "There may possibly be nations
whose livelier feelings incline them more to gesticulation than is common
among us, as there are also countries in which plants of excellent use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg 295]</span>
to man grow spontaneously; these, by care and culture, are found to thrive
also in colder countries."</p>

<p>It is in general to be remarked that as the number of dialects in any
district decreases so will the gestures, though doubtless there is also
weight in the fact not merely that a language has been reduced to
and modified by writing, but that people who are accustomed generally
to read and write, as are the English and Germans, will after a time
think and talk as they write, and without the accompaniments still
persistent
among Hindus, Arabs, and the less literate of European nations.</p>

<p>The fact that in the comparatively small island of Sicily gesture language
has been maintained until the present time in a perfection not
observed elsewhere in Europe must be considered in connection with the
above remark on England's insularity, and it must also be admitted that
several languages have prevailed in the latter, still leaving dialects.
This
apparent similarity of conditions renders the contrast as regards use of
gestures more remarkable, yet there are some reasons for their persistence
in Sicily which apply with greater force than to Great Britain. The
explanation, through mere tradition, is that the common usage of signs
dates from the time of Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse, who prohibited
meetings and conversation among his subjects, under the direst penalties,
so that they adopted that expedient to hold communication. It would be
more useful to consider the peculiar history of the island. The Sicanians
being its aborigines it was colonized by Greeks, who, as the Romans
asserted, were still more apt at gesture than themselves. This colonization
was also by separate bands of adventurers from several different states of
Greece, so that they started with dialects and did not unite in a common
or national organization, the separate cities and their territories being
governed
by oligarchies or tyrants frequently at war with each other, until, in
the fifth century B.C., the Carthaginians began to contribute a new
admixture
of language and blood, followed by Roman, Vandal, Gothic, Herulian,
Arab, and Norman subjugation. Thus some of the conditions above suggested
have existed in this case, but, whatever the explanation, the accounts
given by travelers of the extent to which the language of signs has
been used even during the present generation are so marvelous as to deserve
quotation. The one selected is from the pen of Alexandre Dumas,
who, it is to be hoped, did not carry his genius for romance into a
professedly
sober account of travel:</p>

<p>"In the intervals of the acts of the opera I saw lively conversations
carried on between the orchestra and the boxes. Arami, in particular,
recognized a friend whom he had not seen for three years, and who related
to him, by means of his eyes and his hands, what, to judge by the
eager gestures of my companion, must have been matters of great interest.
The conversation ended, I asked him if I might know without impropriety
what was the intelligence which had seemed to interest him so
deeply. 'O, yes,' he replied, 'that person is one of my good friends, who
has been away from Palermo for three years, and he has been telling
me that he was married at Naples; then traveled with his wife in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg 296]</span>
Austria and in France; there his wife gave birth to a daughter, whom
he had the misfortune to lose; he arrived by steamboat yesterday, but
his wife had suffered so much from sea-sickness that she kept her bed,
and he came alone to the play.' 'My dear friend,' said I to Arami, 'if
you would have me believe you, you must grant me a favor.' 'What is
it?' said he. 'It is, that you do not leave me during the evening, so
that I may be sure you give no instructions to your friend, and when
we join him, that you ask him to repeat aloud what he said to you by
signs.' 'That I will,' said Arami. The curtain then rose; the second
act of Norma was played; the curtain falling, and the actors being
recalled, as usual, we went to the side-room, where we met the traveler.
'My dear friend,' said Arami, 'I did not perfectly comprehend what you
wanted to tell me; be so good as to repeat it.' The traveler repeated
the story word for word, and without varying a syllable from the
translation, which Arami had made of his signs; it was marvelous indeed.</p>

<p>"Six weeks after this, I saw a second example of this faculty of mute
communication. This was at Naples. I was walking with a young
man of Syracuse. We passed by a sentinel. The soldier and my companion
exchanged two or three grimaces, which at another time I should
not even have noticed, but the instances I had before seen led me to
give attention. 'Poor fellow,' sighed my companion. 'What did he
say to you?' I asked. 'Well,' said he, 'I thought that I recognized him
as a Sicilian, and I learned from him, as we passed, from what place he
came; he said he was from Syracuse, and that he knew me well. Then I
asked him how he liked the Neapolitan service; he said he did not like it
at all, and if his officers did not treat him better he should certainly
finish by
deserting. I then signified to him that if he ever should be reduced to
that extremity, he might rely upon me, and that I would aid him all in
my power. The poor fellow thanked me with all his heart, and I have
no doubt that one day or other I shall see him come.' Three days after,
I was at the quarters of my Syracusan friend, when he was told that a
man asked to see him who would not give his name; he went out and
left me nearly ten minutes. 'Well,' said he, on returning, 'just as I
said.' 'What?' said I. 'That the poor fellow would desert.'"</p>

<p>After this there is an excuse for believing the tradition that the
revolt called "the Sicilian Vespers," in 1282, was arranged throughout
the island without the use of a syllable, and even the day and hour for
the massacre of the obnoxious foreigners fixed upon by signs only. Indeed,
the popular story goes so far as to assert that all this was done by
facial expression, without even manual signs.</p>


<h4>NEAPOLITAN SIGNS.</h4>

<p>It is fortunately possible to produce some illustrations of the modern
Neapolitan sign language traced from the plates of De Jorio, with
translations, somewhat condensed, of his descriptions and remarks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/fig76.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig76.png" alt="Public writer. Neapolitan group" /></a>Fig. 76.&mdash;Neapolitan public letter-writer and clients.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/fig77.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig77.png" alt="Money. Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 77.</div>

<p>In Fig. 76 an ambulant secretary or public writer is seated at his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg 297]</span>
little table, on which are the meager tools of his trade. He wears
spectacles in token that he has read and written much, and has one seat at
his side to accommodate his customers. On this is seated a married
woman who asks him to write a letter to her absent husband. The
secretary, not being told what to write about, without surprise, but somewhat
amused, raises his left hand with the ends of the thumb and finger
joined, the other fingers naturally open, a common sign for <i>inquiry</i>.
"What shall the letter be about?" The wife, not being ready of speech,
to rid herself of the embarrassment, resorts to the mimic art, and, without
opening her mouth, tells with simple gestures all that is in her mind.
Bringing her right hand to her heart, with a corresponding glance of the
eyes she shows that the theme is to be <i>love</i>. For emphasis also she
curves the whole upper part of her body towards him, to exhibit the
intensity
of her passion. To complete the mimic story, she makes with her
left hand the sign of <i>asking</i> for something, which has been above
described
(see page <a href="#page291">291</a>). The letter, then, is to assure her husband of her
love and to beg him to return it with corresponding affection. The other
woman, perhaps her sister, who has understood the whole direction, regards
the request as silly and fruitless and is much disgusted. Being
on her feet, she takes a step toward the wife, who she thinks is unadvised,
and raises her left hand with a sign of disapprobation. This position of
the hand is described in full as open, raised high, and oscillated from
right to left. Several of the Indian signs have the
same idea of oscillation of the hand raised,
often near the head, to express <i>folly, fool</i>.
She clearly says, "What a thing to ask!
what a fool you are!" and at the same time
makes with the right hand the sign of <i>money</i>.
This is made by the extremities of the thumb
and index rapidly rubbed against each other,
and is shown more clearly in Fig. 77. It is taken from the handling and
counting of coin. This may be compared with an Indian sign, see Fig.
115, page <a href="#page344">344</a>.</p>

<p>So the sister is clearly disapproving with her left hand and with her
right giving good counsel, as if to say, in the combination, "What a
fool you are to ask for his love; you had better ask him to send you
some money."</p>

<p>In Naples, as in American cities, boiled ears of green corn are vended
with much outcry. Fig. 78 shows a boy who is attracted by the local
cry "<i>Pollanchelle tenerelle!</i>" and seeing the sweet golden ears still
boiling in the kettle from which steams forth fragrance, has an ardent desire
to taste the same, but is without a <i>soldo</i>. He tries begging. His
right open hand is advanced toward the desired object with the sign of
<i>asking</i>
or <i>begging</i>, and he also raises his left forefinger to indicate the
number one&mdash;"Pretty girl, please only give me one!" The pretty girl is by no
means cajoled, and while her left hand holds the ladle ready to use if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg 298]</span>
dares to touch her merchandise, she replies by gesture "<i>Te voglio d&#224; no
cuorno!</i>" freely translated, "I'll give you one <i>in a horn!</i>" This
gesture is drawn, with clearer outline in Fig. 79, and has many
significations, according to the subject-matter and context, and also as
applied to different parts of the body. Applied to the head it has
allusion, descending from high antiquity, to a marital misfortune
which was probably common in prehistoric
times as well as the present. It is also
often used as an amulet against the <i>jettatura</i>
or evil eye, and misfortune in general, and directed toward another person
is a prayerful wish for his or her preservation from evil. This use
is ancient, as is shown on medals and statues, and is supposed by some
to refer to the horns of animals slaughtered in sacrifice. The position
of the fingers, Fig. 80, is also given as
one of Quintilian's oratorical gestures
by the words "<i>Duo quoque medii sub
pollicem veniunt</i>," and is said by him to
be vehement and connected with reproach
or argument. In the present case, as a response to an impertinent
or disagreeable petition, it simply means, "instead of giving what you
ask, I will give you nothing but what is vile and useless, as horns are."</p>

<hr />

<p>Fig. 81 tells a story which is substantially the foundation of the slender
plot of most modern scenic pantomimes preliminary to the bursting
forth from their chrysalides of Harlequin, Columbine, Pantaloon, and
company. A young girl, with the consent of her parents, has for some
time promised her hand to an honest youth. The old mother, in despite
of her word, has taken a caprice to give her daughter to another suitor.
The father, though much under the sway of his spouse, is in his heart
desirous to keep his engagement, and has called in the notary to draw
the contract. At this moment the scene begins, the actors of which, for
greater perspicuity and brevity, may be provided with stage names as
follows:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Cecca, diminutive for Francisca, the mother of&mdash;</p>
<p>Nanella, diminutive of Antoniella, the betrothed of&mdash;</p>
<p>Peppino, diminutive of Peppe, which is diminutive of Giuseppe.</p>
<p>Pasquale, husband of Cecca and father of Nanella.</p>
<p>Tonno, diminutive of Antonio, favored by Cecca.</p>
<p>D. Alfonso, notary.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/fig81.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig81.png" alt="Marriage contract. Neapolitan group" /></a>Fig. 81.&mdash;Disturbance at signing of Neapolitan marriage contract.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width:20%;"><a href="images/fig82.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig82.png" alt="Negation. Pai-Ute sign" /></a>Fig. 82.</div>

<p>Cecca tries to pick a quarrel with Peppino, and declares that the contract
shall not be signed. He reminds her of her promise, and accuses
her of breach of faith. In her passion she calls on her daughter to
repudiate
her lover, and casting her arms around her, commands her to
make the sign of breaking off friendship&mdash;"<i>scocchiare</i>"&mdash;which, she
has herself made to Peppino, and which consists in extending the hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg 299]</span>
with the joined ends of finger and thumb before described, see Fig. 66,
and then separating them, thus breaking the union. This the latter
reluctantly
pretends to do with one hand, yet with the other, which is concealed
from her irate mother's sight, shows her constancy by continuing
with emphatic pressure the sign of <i>love</i>. According to the gesture
vocabulary,
on the sign <i>scocchiare</i> being made to a person who is willing to
accept the breach of former affection, he replies in the same manner, or
still more forcibly by inserting the index of the other hand between
the index and thumb of the first, thus showing the separation by the
presence of a material obstacle. Simply refraining from holding out the
hand in any responsive gesture is sufficient to indicate that the breach
is not accepted, but that the party addressed desires to continue in
friendship instead of resolving into enmity. This weak and inactive
negative, however, does not suit Peppino's vivacity, who, placing his
left hand on his bosom, makes, with his right, one of the signs for
emphatic
negation. This consists of the palm turned to the person addressed
with the index somewhat extended and separated from the other
fingers, the whole hand being oscillated from right to left.
This gesture appears on ancient Greek vases, and is compound,
the index being demonstrative and the negation
shown by the horizontal oscillation, the whole being translatable
as, "That thing I want not, won't have, reject."
The sign is virtually the same as that made by Arapaho
and Cheyenne Indians (see <span class="sc">Extracts from Dictionary</span>,
page <a href="#page440">440</a>, <i>infra</i>.). The conception of oscillation to
show negation also appears with different execution in the
sign of the Jicarilla Apaches and the Pai-Utes, Fig. 82.
The same sign is reported from Japan, in the same sense.</p>

<p>Tonno, in hopes that the quarrel is definitive, to do his part in stopping
the ceremony, proceeds to blow out the three lighted candles, which
are an important traditional feature of the rite. The good old man
Pasquale,
with his hands extended, raised in surprised displeasure and
directed toward the insolent youth, stops his attempt. The veteran
notary, familiar with such quarrels in his experience, smiles at this one,
and, continuing in his quiet attitude, extends his right hand placidly to
Peppino with the sign of <i>adagio</i>, before described, see Fig. 68,
advising
him not to get excited, but to persist quietly, and all would be well.</p>

<hr />

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/fig83.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig83.png" alt="Coming home of bride. Neapolitan group" /></a>Fig. 83.&mdash;Coming home of Neapolitan bride.</div>

<p>Fig. 83 portrays the first entrance of a bride to her husband's house.
She comes in with a tender and languid mien, her pendent arms indicating
soft yielding, and the right hand loosely holds a handkerchief, ready
to apply in case of overpowering emotion. She is, or feigns to be, so
timid and embarrassed as to require support by the arm of a friend who
introduces her. She is followed by a male friend of the family, whose
joyful face is turned toward supposed by-standers, right hand pointing
to the new acquisition, while with his left he makes the sign of horns
before described, see Fig. 79, which in this connection is to wish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg 300]</span>
prosperity and avert misfortune, and is equivalent to the words in the
Neapolitan
dialect, "<i>Mal'uocchie non nce pozzano</i>"&mdash;may evil eyes never have
power over her.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:20%;"><a href="images/fig84.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig84.png" alt="Pretty. Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 84.</div>

<p>The female confidant, who supports and guides her embarrassed friend
with her right arm, brings her left hand into the sign of
<i>beautiful</i>&mdash;"See
what a beauty she is!" This sign is made by the thumb and index open
and severally lightly touching each side of the lower cheek, the other
fingers open. It is given on a larger scale and slightly varied in Fig. 84,
evidently referring to a fat and rounded visage. Almost
the same sign is made by the Ojibwas of Lake Superior,
and a mere variant of it is made by the Dakotas&mdash;stroking
the cheeks alternately down to the tip
of the chin with the palm or surface of the extended fingers.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:25%;"><a href="images/fig85.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig85.png" alt="&quot;Mano in fica.&quot; Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 85.</div>

<p>The mother-in-law greets the bride by making the
sign <i>mano in fica</i> with her right hand. This sign, made
with the hand clenched and the point of the thumb between
and projecting beyond the fore and middle fingers,
is more distinctly shown in Fig. 85. It has a very
ancient origin, being found on Greek antiques that have escaped the
destruction of time, more particularly in bronzes, and undoubtedly refers
to the <i>pudendum muliebre</i>. It is used offensively and ironically, but
also&mdash;which is doubtless the case in this instance&mdash;as
an invocation or prayer against evil, being more
forcible than the horn-shaped gesture before described.
With this sign the Indian sign for <i>female</i>,
see Fig. 132, page <a href="#page357">357</a>, <i>infra</i>, may be compared.</p>

<p>The mother-in-law also places her left hand hollowed
in front of her abdomen, drawing with it her
gown slightly forward, thereby making a pantomimic
representation of the state in which "women wish to be who love
their lords"; the idea being plainly an expressed hope that the household
will be blessed with a new generation.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:20%;"><a href="images/fig86.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig86.png" alt="Snapping the fingers. Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 86.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width:18%;"><a href="images/fig87.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig87.png" alt="Joy, acclamation" /></a>Fig. 87.</div>

<p>Next to her is a hunchback, who is present as a familiar clown or
merrymaker, and dances and laughs to please the company,
at the same time snapping his fingers. Two other
illustrations of this action, the middle finger in one leaving
and in the other having left the thumb and passed to its
base, are seen in Figs. 86, 87. This gesture by itself has,
like others mentioned, a great variety of significations,
but here means <i>joy</i> and acclamation. It is
frequently used among us for subdued applause,
less violent than clapping the two
hands, but still oftener to express negation
with disdain, and also carelessness. Both these
uses of it are common in Naples, and appear in Etruscan vases and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg 301]</span>
Pompeian paintings, as well as in the classic authors. The significance of
the action in the hand of the contemporary statue of Sardanapalus at
Anchiale
is clearly <i>worthlessness</i>, as shown by the inscription in Assyrian,
"Sardanapalus, the son of Anacyndaraxes, built in one day Anchiale
and Tarsus. Eat, drink, play; the rest is not worth <i>that</i>!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:25%;"><a href="images/fig88.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig88.png" alt="Invitation to drink wine" /></a>Fig. 88.</div>

<p>The bridegroom has left his mother to do the honors to the bride, and
himself attends to the rest of the company, inviting one of them to
drink some wine by a sign, enlarged in Fig. 88, which is not merely
pointing to the mouth with the thumb, but the hand with
the incurved fingers represents the body of the common
glass flask which the Neapolitans use, the extended
thumb being its neck; the invitation is therefore
specially to drink wine. The guest, however,
responds by a very obvious gesture that he don't wish
anything to drink, but he would like to eat some
macaroni, the fingers being disposed as if handling
that comestible in the fashion of vulgar Italians. If
the idea were only to eat generally, it would have
been expressed by the fingers and thumb united in a point and moved
several times near and toward the mouth, not raised above it, as is
necessary for suspending the strings of macaroni.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/fig89.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig89.png" alt="Woman's quarrel. Neapolitan group" /></a>Fig. 89.&mdash;Quarrel between Neapolitan women.</div>

<p>In Fig. 89 the female in the left of the group is much disgusted at
seeing one of her former acquaintances, who has met with good fortune,
promenade in a fine costume with her husband. Overcome with jealousy,
she spreads out her dress derisively on both sides, in imitation of the
hoop-skirts once worn by women of rank, as if to say "So you are playing
the great lady!" The insulted woman, in resentment, makes with both
hands, for double effect, the sign of horns, before described, which in
this
case is done obviously in menace and imprecation. The husband is a
pacific fellow who is not willing to get into a woman's quarrel, and is
very
easily held back by a woman and small boy who happen to join the group.
He contents himself with pretending to be in a great passion and biting
his finger, which gesture may be collated with the emotional clinching
of the teeth and biting the lips in anger, common to all mankind.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/fig90.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig90.png" alt="Chestnut vender" /></a>Fig. 90.&mdash;The cheating Neapolitan chestnut huckster.</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width:20%;"><a href="images/fig91.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig91.png" alt="Warning. Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 91.</div>

<p>In Fig. 90 a contadina, or woman from the country, who has come to
the city to sell eggs (shown to be such by her head-dress, and the form
of the basket which she has deposited on the ground), accosts a vender
of roast chestnuts and asks for a measure of them. The chestnut
huckster says they are very fine and asks a price beyond that of the
market; but a boy sees that the rustic woman is not sharp in worldly
matters
and desires to warn her against the cheat. He therefore, at the moment
when he can catch her eye, pretending to lean upon his basket, and
moving thus a little behind the huckster, so as not to be seen, points him
out with his index finger, and lays his left forefinger under his eye,
pulling
down the skin slightly, so as to deform the regularity of the lower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg 302]</span>
eyelid. This is a <i>warning against a cheat</i>, shown more clearly in
Fig. 91.
This sign primarily indicates a squinting person, and metaphorically one
whose looks cannot be trusted, even as in a squinting
person you cannot be certain in which direction he is looking.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:35%;"><a href="images/fig92.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig92.png" alt="Justice. Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 92.</div>

<p>Fig. 92 shows the extremities of the index and thumb
closely joined in form of a cone, and turned down, the
other fingers held at pleasure, and the hand and arm
advanced to the point and held steady. This signifies
<i>justice</i>, a just person, that which is just and right. The
same sign may denote friendship, a menace, which specifically is that of
being brought to justice, and snuff, <i>i.e.</i> powdered tobacco; but the
expression of the countenance and the circumstance of
the use of the sign determine these distinctions.
Its origin is clearly the balance or emblem of
justice, the office of which consists in ascertaining
physical weight, and thence comes the moral
idea of distinguishing clearly what is just and
accurate and what is not. The hand is presented in the usual manner

<p>Fig. 93 signifies <i>little, small</i>, both as regards the size of physical
objects or figuratively, as of a small degree of talent, affection, or the
like. It is made either by the point of
the thumb placed under the end
of the index (<i>a</i>), or <i>vice versa</i> (<i>b</i>),
and the other fingers held at will,
but separated from those mentioned. The intention is to exhibit a small
portion either of the thumb
or index separated from the rest of the hand. The gesture is found
in Herculanean bronzes, with obviously the same signification.
The signs made by some tribes of Indians for the
same conception are very similar, as is seen by Figs. 94 and 95.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:16%;"><a href="images/fig96.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig96.png" alt="Demonstration. Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 96.</div>

<p>Fig. 96 is simply the index extended by itself. The other
fingers are generally bent inwards and pressed down by the
thumb, as mentioned by Quintilian, but that is not necessary
to the gesture if the forefinger is distinctly separated
from the rest. It is most commonly used for indication,
pointing out, as it is over all the world, from which comes the
name index, applied by the Romans as also by us, to the
forefinger. In different relations to the several parts of
the body and arm positions it has many significations, <i>e.g.</i>,
attention, meditation, derision, silence, number, and demonstration in
general.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/fig97.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig97.png" alt="&quot;Fool.&quot; Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 97.</div>

<p>Fig. 97 represents the head of a jackass, the thumbs being the ears,
and the separation of the little from the third fingers showing the jaws.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/fig98.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig98.png" alt="&quot;Fool.&quot; Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 98.</div>

<p>Fig. 98 is intended to portray the head of the same animal in a front
view, the hands being laid upon each other, with thumbs extending
on each side to represent the ears. In each case the thumbs are
generally moved forward and back, in the manner of the quadruped, which,
without
much apparent reason, has been selected as the
emblem of stupidity. The sign, therefore, means <i>stupid, fool</i>.
Another mode of executing the same conception&mdash;the ears of an ass&mdash;is shown
in Fig. 99, where the end of the thumb is applied to the ear or temple and
the hand is wagged up and down. Whether the ancient
Greeks had the same low opinion of the ass as is now entertained is not
clear, but they regarded long ears with derision, and Apollo,
as a punishment to Midas for his foolish decision, bestowed on him the
lengthy ornaments of the patient beast.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:35%;"><a href="images/fig99.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig99.png" alt="&quot;Fool.&quot; Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 99.</div>

<p>Fig. 100 is the fingers elongated and united in a point, turned upwards.
The hand is raised slightly toward the face of the gesturer and shaken a
few times in the direction of the person conversed with. This is
<i>inquiry</i>, not a mere interrogative, but to express that the person
addressed has not been clearly understood, perhaps
from the vagueness or diffusiveness of his expressions.
The idea appears to suggest the
gathering of his thoughts together into one
distinct expression, or to be <i>pointed</i> in what he wishes to say.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:35%;"><a href="images/fig101.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig101.png" alt="Crafty, deceitful. Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 101.</div>

<p><i>Crafty, deceitful</i>, Fig. 101. The little fingers
of both reversed hands are hooked together,
the others open but slightly curved,
and, with the hands, moved several times to the right and left. The gesture
is intended to represent a crab and the tortuous movements of the
crustacean, which are likened to those of a man who cannot be depended
on in his walk through life. He is not straight.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:25%;"><a href="images/fig102.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig102.png" alt="Insult. Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 102.</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/fig103.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig103.png" alt="Insult. Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 103.</div>

<p>Figs. 102 and 103 are different positions of the hand in which the
approximating
thumb and forefinger form a circle. This is the direst insult
that can be given. The amiable canon De Jorio only hints at its
special significance, but it may be evident to persons aware of a practice
disgraceful to Italy. It is very ancient.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:25%;"><a href="images/fig104.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig104.png" alt="Silence. Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 104.</div>

<p>Fig. 104 is easily recognized as a request or command to be <i>silent</i>,
either on the occasion or on the subject. The mouth, supposed to be
forcibly closed, prevents speaking, and the natural gesture, as might be
supposed, is historically ancient, but the instance, frequently adduced
from the attitude of the god Harpokrates, whose finger is on his lips, is
an error. The Egyptian hieroglyphists, notably in the designation of
Horus, their dawn-god, used the finger in or on the lips for "child." It
has been conjectured in the last instance that the gesture
implied, not the mode of taking nourishment, but
inability to speak&mdash;<i>in-fans</i>. This conjecture, however,
was only made to explain the blunder of the Greeks,
who saw in the hand placed connected with the mouth in the hieroglyph
of Horus (the) son, "Hor-(p)-chrot," the gesture familiar to
themselves of a finger on the lips to express "silence," and so, mistaking
both the name and the characterization, invented the God of
Silence, Harpokrates. A careful examination of all the linear hieroglyphs
given by Champollion (<i>Dictionnaire Egyptien</i>) shows that the
finger or the hand to the mouth of an adult (whose posture is always
distinct from that of a child) is always in connection with the positive
ideas of voice, mouth, speech, writing, eating, drinking, &amp;c., and never
with the negative idea of silence. The special character for <i>child</i>,
Fig. 105, always has the above-mentioned part of the sign
with reference to nourishment from the breast.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:15%;"><a href="images/fig105.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig105.png" alt="Child. Egyptian hieroglyph" /></a>Fig. 105.</div>

<p>Fig. 106 is a forcible <i>negation</i>. The outer ends of
the fingers united in a point under the chin
are violently thrust forward. This is the rejection
of an idea or proposition, the same conception being executed in several
different modes by the North American Indians.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:25%;"><a href="images/fig106.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig106.png" alt="Negation. Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 106.</div>

<p>Fig. 107 signifies <i>hunger</i>, and is made by extending the thumb and
index under the open mouth and turning them horizontally and vertically
several times. The idea is emptiness and desire to be filled. It is
also expressed by beating the ribs with the flat hands, to show that the
sides meet or are weak for the want of something between them.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/fig107.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig107.png" alt="Hunger. Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 107.</div>

<p>Fig. 108 is made in mocking and ridicule. The open and oscillating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg 305]</span>
hand touches the point of the nose with that of the thumb. It has the
particular sense of stigmatizing the person addressed or in question as a
dupe. A credulous person is generally imagined with a gaping mouth and
staring eyes, and as thrusting forward his face, with pendant chin, so that
the nose is well advanced and therefore most prominent in the profile. A
dupe is therefore called <i>naso lungo</i> or long-nose, and with Italian
writers "<i>restare con
un palmo di naso</i>"&mdash;to be left with a palm's length of nose&mdash;means
to have met with loss, injury, or disappointment.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:35%;"><a href="images/fig108.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig108.png" alt="Mockery. Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 108.</div>

<p>The thumb stroking the forehead from one side to the other, Fig. 109,
is a natural sign of <i>fatigue</i>, and of the physical toil that produces
fatigue. The wiping off of perspiration is obviously
indicated. This gesture is often used ironically.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:25%;"><a href="images/fig109.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig109.png" alt="Fatigue. Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 109.</div>

<p>As a <i>dupe</i> was shown above, now the <i>duper</i> is signified, by
Fig. 110. The gesture is to
place the fingers between the
cravat and the neck and rub
the latter with the back of the hand. The idea is that the deceit
is put within the cravat, taken in and down, similar to our phrase to
"swallow" a false and deceitful story, and a "cram" is also an English
slang word for an incredible lie. The conception of the slang term is
nearly related to that of the Neapolitan sign, viz., the artificial
enlargement of the &oelig;sophagus of the person victimized or on whom imposition
is attempted to be practiced, which is necessary to take it down.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:35%;"><a href="images/fig110.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig110.png" alt="Deceit. Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 110.</div>

<p>Fig. 111 shows the ends of the index and
thumb stroking the two sides of the nose from
base to point. This means <i>astute, attentive, ready</i>.
Sharpness of the nasal organ is popularly associated
with subtlety and finesse. The old Romans
by <i>homo emunct&#230; naris</i> meant an acute
man attentive to his interests. The sign is often
used in a bad sense, then signifying <i>too</i> sharp to
be trusted.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:35%;"><a href="images/fig111.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig111.png" alt="Astuteness, readiness. Neapolitan" /></a>Fig. 111.</div>

<p>This somewhat lengthy but yet only partial list of Neapolitan gesture-signs
must conclude with one common throughout Italy, and also among us with a
somewhat different signification, yet perhaps also derived from classic
times. To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[pg 306]</span>
express suspicion of a person the forefinger of the right hand is placed
upon the side of the nose. It means <i>tainted</i>, not sound. It is used to
give an unfavorable report of a person inquired of and to warn against such.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Chinese, though ready in gesticulation and divided by dialects,
do not appear to make general use of a systematic sign language, but
they adopt an expedient rendered possible by the peculiarity of their
written characters, with which a large proportion of their adults are
acquainted, and which are common in form to the whole empire. The inhabitants
of different provinces when meeting, and being unable to converse
orally, do not try to do so, but write the characters of the words
upon the ground or trace them on the palm of the hand or in the air.
Those written characters each represent words in the same manner as
do the Arabic or Roman numerals, which are the same to Italians, Germans,
French, and English, and therefore intelligible, but if expressed
in sound or written in full by the alphabet, would not be mutually
understood. This device of the Chinese was with less apparent necessity
resorted to in the writer's personal knowledge between a Hungarian
who could talk Latin, and a then recent graduate from college who could
also do so to some extent, but their pronunciation was so different as to
occasion constant difficulty, so they both wrote the words on paper,
instead of attempting to speak them.</p>

<p>The efforts at intercommunication of all savage and barbarian tribes,
when brought into contact with other bodies of men not speaking an
oral language common to both, and especially when uncivilized inhabitants
of the same territory are separated by many linguistic divisions,
should in theory resemble the devices of the North American Indians.
They are not shown by published works to prevail in the Eastern hemisphere
to the same extent and in the same manner as in North America.
It is, however, probable that they exist in many localities, though not
reported, and also that some of them survive after partial or even high
civilization has been attained, and after changed environment has rendered
their systematic employment unnecessary. Such signs may be,
first, unconnected with existing oral language, and used in place of it;
second, used to explain or accentuate the words of ordinary speech, or
third, they may consist of gestures, emotional or not, which are only
noticed in oratory or impassioned conversation, being, possibly, survivals
of a former gesture language.</p>

<p>From correspondence instituted it may be expected that a considerable
collection of signs will be obtained from West and South Africa,
India, Arabia, Turkey, the Fiji Islands, Sumatra, Madagascar, Ceylon,
and especially from Australia, where the conditions are similar in many
respects to those prevailing in North America prior to the Columbian
discovery.
In the <i>Aborigines of Victoria, Melbourne</i>, 1878, by R. Brough
Smythe, the author makes the following curious remarks: "It is believed
that they have several signs, known only to themselves, or to those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg 307]</span>
among the whites who have had intercourse with them for lengthened
periods, which convey information readily and accurately. Indeed, because
of their use of signs, it is the firm belief of many (some uneducated
and some educated) that the natives of Australia are acquainted with
the secrets of Freemasonry."</p>

<p>In the <i>Report of the cruise of the United States Revenue steamer
Corwin in the Arctic Ocean, Washington</i>, 1881, it appears that the
Innuits
of the northwestern extremity of America use signs continually.
Captain Hooper, commanding that steamer, is reported by Mr. Petroff
to have found that the natives of Nunivak Island, on the American side,
below Behring Strait, trade by signs with those of the Asiatic coast,
whose language is different. Humboldt in his journeyings among the
Indians of the Orinoco, where many small isolated tribes spoke languages
not understood by any other, found the language of signs in full operation.
Spix and Martius give a similar account of the Puris and Coroados of Brazil.</p>

<hr />

<p>It is not necessary to enlarge under the present heading upon the
signs of deaf-mutes, except to show the intimate relation between sign
language as practiced by them and the gesture signs, which, even if not
"natural," are intelligible to the most widely separated of mankind. A
Sandwich Islander, a Chinese, and the Africans from the slaver Amistad
have, in published instances, visited our deaf-mute institutions
with the same result of free and pleasurable intercourse; and an English
deaf-mute had no difficulty in conversing with Laplanders. It appears,
also, on the authority of Sibscota, whose treatise was published
in 1670, that Cornelius Haga, ambassador of the United Provinces to
the Sublime Porte, found the Sultan's mutes to have established a language
among themselves in which they could discourse with a speaking
interpreter, a degree of ingenuity interfering with the object of their
selection as slaves unable to repeat conversation. A curious instance has
also been reported to the writer of operatives in a large mill where the
constant rattling of the machinery rendered them practically deaf during
the hours of work and where an original system of gestures was adopted.</p>

<p>In connection with the late international convention, at Milan, of persons
interested in the instruction of deaf-mutes which, in the enthusiasm
of the members for the new system of artificial articulate speech, made
war upon all gesture-signs, it is curious that such prohibition of gesture
should be urged regarding mutes when it was prevalent to so great an
extent among the speaking people of the country where the convention
was held, and when the advocates of it were themselves so dependent
on gestures to assist their own oratory if not their ordinary conversation.
Artificial articulation surely needs the aid of significant gestures
more, when in the highest perfection to which it can attain, than does oral
speech in its own high development. The use of artificial speech is also
necessarily confined to the oral language acquired by the interlocutors
and throws away the advantage of universality possessed by signs.</p>

<h3><i>USE BY MODERN ACTORS AND ORATORS.</i></h3>

<p>Less of practical value can be learned of sign language, considered as
a system, from the study of gestures of actors and orators than would
appear without reflection. The pantomimist who uses no words whatever
is obliged to avail himself of every natural or imagined connection
between thought and gesture, and, depending wholly on the latter,
makes himself intelligible. On the stage and the rostrum words are
the main reliance, and gestures generally serve for rhythmic movement
and to display personal grace. At the most they give the appropriate
representation of the general idea expressed by the words, but do not
attempt to indicate the idea itself. An instance is recorded of the
addition
of significance to gesture when it is employed by the gesturer,
himself silent, to accompany words used by another. Livius Andronicus,
being hoarse, obtained permission to have his part sung by
another actor while he continued to make the gestures, and he did so
with much greater effect than before, as Livy, the historian, explains,
because he was not impeded by the exertion of the voice; but the correct
explanation probably is, because his attention was directed to ideas,
not mere words.</p>


<h4>GESTURES OF ACTORS.</h4>

<p>To look at the performance of a play through thick glass or with closed
ears has much the same absurd effect that is produced by also stopping
the ears while at a ball and watching the apparently objectless capering
of the dancers, without the aid of musical accompaniment. Diderot,
in his <i>Lettre sur les sourds muets</i>, gives his experience as follows:</p>

<p>"I used frequently to attend the theater and I knew by heart most
of our good plays. Whenever I wished to criticise the movements and
gestures of the actors I went to the third tier of boxes, for the further
I was from them the better I was situated for this purpose. As soon
as the curtain rose, and the moment came when the other spectators
disposed themselves to listen, I put my fingers into my ears, not without
causing some surprise among those who surrounded me, who, not
understanding, almost regarded me as a crazy man who had come to
the play only not to hear it. I was very little embarrassed by their
comments, however, and obstinately kept my ears closed as long as the
action and gestures of the players seemed to me to accord with the discourse
which I recollected. I listened only when I failed to see the
appropriateness of the gestures.. There are few actors capable
of sustaining such a test, and the details into which I could enter
would be mortifying to most of them."</p>

<p>It will be noticed that Diderot made this test with regard to the
appropriate gestural representation of plays that he knew by heart, but if
he had been entirely without any knowledge of the plot, the difficulty in
his comprehending it from gestures alone would have been enormously
increased. When many admirers of Ristori, who were wholly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg 309]</span>
unacquainted with the language in which her words were delivered, declared
that her gesture and expression were so perfect that they understood
every sentence, it is to be doubted if they would have been so delighted
if they had not been thoroughly familiar with the plots of Queen Elizabeth
and Mary Stuart. This view is confirmed by the case of a deaf-mute,
told to the writer by Professor <span class="sc">Fay</span>, who had prepared to enjoy
Ristori's acting by reading in advance the advertised play, but on his
reaching the theater another play was substituted and he could derive no
idea from its presentation. The experience of the present writer is that
he could gain very little meaning in detail out of the performance at a
Chinese theater, where there is much more true pantomime than in the
European, without a general notion of the subject as conveyed from
time to time by an interpreter. A crucial test on this subject was made
at the representation at Washington, in April, 1881, of <i>Frou-Frou</i> by
Sarah Bernhardt and the excellent French company supporting her.
Several persons of special intelligence and familiar with theatrical
performances, but who did not understand spoken French, and had not heard
or read the play before or even seen an abstract of it, paid close
attention to ascertain what they could learn of the plot and incidents from
the gestures alone. This could be determined in the special play the
more certainly as it is not founded on historic events or any known
facts. The result was that from the entrance of the heroine during the
first scene in a peacock-blue riding habit to her death in a black
walking-suit,
three hours or five acts later, none of the students formed any distinct
conception of the plot. This want of apprehension extended even
to uncertainty whether <i>Gilberte</i> was married or not; that is, whether
her adventures were those of a disobedient daughter or a faithless wife,
and, if married, which of the half dozen male personages was her husband.
There were gestures enough, indeed rather a profusion of them,
and they were thoroughly appropriate to the words (when those were
understood) in which fun, distress, rage, and other emotions were
expressed, but in no cases did they interpret the motive for those
emotions.
They were the dressing for the words of the actors as the superb
millinery was that of their persons, and perhaps acted as varnish to
bring out dialogues and soliloquies in heightened effect. But though
varnish can bring into plainer view dull or faded characters, it cannot
introduce into them significance where none before existed. The simple
fact was that the gestures of the most famed histrionic school, the
Com&#233;die Fran&#231;aise, were not significant, far less self-interpreting, and
though praised as the perfection of art, have diverged widely from
nature. It thus appears that the absence of absolute self-interpretation
by gesture is by no means confined to the lower grade of actors, such as
are criticised in the old lines:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>When to enforce some very tender part</p>
<p>His left hand sleeps by instinct on the heart;</p>
<p>His soul, of every other thought bereft,</p>
<p>Seems anxious only&mdash;where to place the left!</p>
  </div>  </div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg 310]</span>

<p>Without relying wholly upon the facts above mentioned, it will be
admitted upon reflection that however numerous and correct may be
the actually significant gestures made by a great actor in the
representation
of his part, they must be in small proportion to the number of
gestures not at all significant, and which are no less necessary to give
to his declamation precision, grace, and force. Significant gestures on
the stage may be regarded in the nature of high seasoning and
ornamentation, which by undue use defeat their object and create disgust.
Histrionic perfection is, indeed, more shown in the slight shades of
movement of the head, glances of the eye, and poises of the body than
in violent attitudes; but these slight movements are wholly unintelligible
without the words uttered with them. Even in the expression of
strong emotion the same gesture will apply to many and utterly diverse
conditions of fact. The greatest actor in telling that his father was
dead can convey his grief with a shade of difference from that which
he would use if saying that his wife had run away, his son been arrested
for murder, or his house burned down; but that shade would not without
words inform any person, ignorant of the supposed event, which of
the four misfortunes had occurred. A true sign language, however,
would fully express the exact circumstances, either with or without any
exhibition of the general emotion appropriate to them.</p>

<p>Even among the best sign-talkers, whether Indian or deaf-mute, it is
necessary to establish some <i>rapport</i> relating to theme or
subject-matter,
since many gestures, as indeed is the case in a less degree with spoken
words, have widely different significations, according to the object of
their exhibition, as well as the context. Panurge (<i>Pantagruel</i>, Book
III, ch. xix) hits the truth upon this point, however ungallant in his
application of it to the fair sex. He is desirous to consult a dumb man,
but says it would be useless to apply to a woman, for "whatever it be
that they see they do always represent unto their fancies, and imagine
that it hath some relation to love. Whatever signs, shows, or gestures
we shall make, or whatever our behavior, carriage, or demeanor
shall happen to be in their view and presence, they will interpret the
whole in reference to androgynation." A story is told to the same point
by Guevara, in his fabulous life of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. A
young Roman gentleman encountering at the foot of Mount Celion a
beautiful Latin lady, who from her very cradle had been deaf and dumb,
asked her in gesture what senators in her descent from the top of the
hill she had met with, going up thither. She straightway imagined that
he had fallen in love with her and was eloquently proposing marriage,
whereupon she at once threw herself into his arms in acceptance. The
experience of travelers on the Plains is to the same general effect, that
signs commonly used to men are understood by women in a sense so
different as to occasion embarrassment. So necessary was it to strike
the mental key-note of the spectators by adapting their minds to time,
place, and circumstance, that even in the palmiest days of pantomime
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[pg 311]</span>
it was customary for the crier to give some short preliminary explanation
of what was to be acted, which advantage is now retained by our
play-bills, always more specific when the performance is in a foreign
language, unless, indeed, the management is interested in the sale of
librettos.</p>


<h4>GESTURES OF OUR PUBLIC SPEAKERS.</h4>

<p>If the scenic gestures are so seldom significant, those appropriate to
oratory are of course still less so. They require energy, variety, and
precision,
but also a degree of simplicity which is incompatible with the needs
of sign language. As regards imitation, they are restrained within narrow
bounds and are equally suited to a great variety of sentiments. Among the
admirable illustrations in Austin's <i>Chironomia</i> of gestures
applicable to
the several passages in Gay's "Miser and Plutus" one is given for "But
virtue's sold" which is perfectly appropriate, but is not in the slightest
degree suggestive either of virtue or of the transaction of sale. It could
be used for an indefinite number of thoughts or objects which properly
excited abhorrence, and therefore without the words gives no special
interpretation.
Oratorical delivery demands general grace&mdash;cannot rely
upon the emotions of the moment for spontaneous appropriateness, and
therefore requires preliminary study and practice, such as are applied to
dancing and fencing with a similar object; indeed, accomplishment in
both dancing and fencing has been recommended as of use to all orators.
In reference to this subject a quotation from Lord Chesterfield's letters
is in place: "I knew a young man, who, being just elected a member of
Parliament, was laughed at for being discovered, through the key-hole
of his chamber door, speaking to himself in the glass and forming his
looks and gestures. I could not join in that laugh, but, on the contrary,
thought him much wiser than those that laughed at him, for he knew
the importance of those little graces in a public assembly and they did not."</p>




<h2>OUR INDIAN CONDITIONS FAVORABLE TO SIGN LANGUAGE.</h2>


<p>In no other thoroughly explored part of the world has there been
found spread over so large a space so small a number of individuals
divided by so many linguistic and dialectic boundaries as in North
America. Many wholly distinct tongues have for an indefinitely long time
been confined to a few scores of speakers, verbally incomprehensible to
all others on the face of the earth who did not, from some rarely operating
motive, laboriously acquire their language. Even when the American
race, so styled, flourished in the greatest population of which we
have any evidence (at least according to the published views of the
present writer, which seem to have been generally accepted), the immense
number of languages and dialects still preserved, or known by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[pg 312]</span>
early recorded fragments to have once existed, so subdivided it that
only the dwellers in a very few villages could talk together with ease.
They were all interdistributed among unresponsive vernaculars, each to
the other being <i>bar-bar-ous</i> in every meaning of the term. The number
of known stocks or families of Indian languages within the territory of
the United States amounts now to sixty-five, and these differ among
themselves as radically as each differs from the Hebrew, Chinese, or
English. In each of these linguistic families there are several, sometimes
as many as twenty, separate languages, which also differ from
each other as much as do the English, French, German, and Persian
divisions of the Aryan linguistic stock.</p>

<p>The use of gesture-signs, continued, if not originating, in necessity
for communication with the outer world, became entribally convenient
from the habits of hunters, the main occupation of all savages, depending
largely upon stealthy approach to game, and from the sole form of
their military tactics&mdash;to surprise an enemy. In the still expanse of
virgin forests, and especially in the boundless solitudes of the great
plains, a slight sound can be heard over a large area, that of the human
voice being from its rarity the most startling, so that it is now, as
it probably has been for centuries, a common precaution for members of a
hunting or war party not to speak together when on such expeditions,
communicating exclusively by signs. The acquired habit also exhibits
itself not only in formal oratory and in impassioned or emphatic
conversation, but also as a picturesque accompaniment to ordinary social
talk. Hon. <span class="sc">Lewis H. Morgan</span> mentions in a letter to this writer that he
found a silent but happy family composed of an Atsina (commonly
called Gros Ventre of the Prairie) woman, who had been married two
years to a Frenchman, during which time they had neither of them attempted
to learn each other's language; but the husband having taken
kindly to the language of signs, they conversed together by that means
with great contentment. It is also often resorted to in mere laziness,
one gesture saving many words. The gracefulness, ingenuity, and apparent
spontaneity of the greater part of the signs can never be realized
until actually witnessed, and their beauty is much heightened by the
free play to which the arms of these people are accustomed, and the small
and well-shaped hands for which they are remarkable. Among them
can seldom be noticed in literal fact&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The graceless action of a heavy hand&mdash;</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>which the Bastard metaphorically condemns in King John.</p>

<p>The conditions upon which the survival of sign language among the
Indians has depended is well shown by those attending its discontinuance
among certain tribes.</p>

<p>Many instances are known of the discontinuance of gesture speech
with no development in the native language of the gesturers, but from
the invention for intercommunication of one used in common. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg 313]</span>
Kalapuyas of Southern Oregon until recently used a sign language, but
have gradually adopted for foreign intercourse the composite tongue,
commonly called the Tsinuk or Chinook jargon, which probably arose
for trade purposes on the Columbia River before the advent of Europeans,
founded on the Tsinuk, Tsihali, Nutka, &amp;c., but now enriched by
English and French terms, and have nearly forgotten their old signs.
The prevalence of this mongrel speech, originating in the same causes
that produced the pigeon-English or <i>lingua-franca</i> of the Orient,
explains the marked scantiness of sign language among the tribes of the
Northwest coast.</p>

<p>Where the Chinook jargon has not extended on the coast to the North,
the Russian language commences, used in the same manner, but it has not
reached so deeply into the interior of the continent as the Chinook, which
has been largely adopted within the region bounded by the eastern line
of Oregon and Washington, and has become known even to the Pai-Utes
of Nevada. The latter, however, while using it with the Oregonian
tribes to their west and north, still keep up sign language for
communication with the Banaks, who have not become so familiar with the
Chinook. The Alaskan tribes on the coast also used signs not more than
a generation ago, as is proved by the fact that some of the older men
can yet converse by this means with the natives of the interior, whom
they occasionally meet. Before the advent of the Russians the coast
tribes traded their dried fish and oil for the skins and paints of the
eastern tribes by visiting the latter, whom they did not allow to come to the
coast, and this trade was conducted mainly in sign language. The
Russians brought a better market, so the travel to the interior ceased,
and with it the necessity for the signs, which therefore gradually died
out, and are little known to the present generation on the coast, though
still continuing in the interior, where the inhabitants are divided by
dialects.</p>

<p>No explanation is needed for the disuse of a language of signs for the
special purpose now in question when the speech of surrounding civilization
is recognized as necessary or important to be acquired, and
gradually becomes known as the best common medium, even before it is
actually spoken by many individuals of the several tribes. When it
has become general, signs, as systematically employed before, gradually
fade away.</p>




<h2>THEORIES ENTERTAINED RESPECTING INDIAN SIGNS.</h2>


<p>In this paper it is not designed to pronounce upon theories, and certainly
none will be advocated in a spirit of dogmatism. The writer recognizes
that the subject in its novelty specially requires an objective
and not a subjective consideration. His duty is to collect the facts as
they are, and this as soon as possible, since every year will add to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg 314]</span>
confusion and difficulty. After the facts are established the theories
will take care of themselves, and their final enunciation will be in the
hands of men more competent than the writer will ever pretend to be,
although his knowledge, after careful study of all data attainable, may
be considerably increased. The mere collection of facts, however, cannot be
prosecuted to advantage without predetermined rules of judgment,
nor can they be classified at all without the adoption of some principle
which involves a tentative theory. More than a generation ago Baader
noticed that scientific observers only accumulated great masses of separate
facts without establishing more connection between them than an
arbitrary and imperfect classification; and before him Goethe complained
of the indisposition of students of nature to look upon the universe
as a whole. But since the great theory of evolution has been
brought to general notice no one will be satisfied at knowing a fact
without also trying to establish its relation to other facts. Therefore a
working hypothesis, which shall not be held to with tenacity, is not only
allowable but necessary. It is also important to examine with proper
respect the theories advanced by others. Some of these, suggested in
the few publications on the subject and also by correspondents, will be
mentioned.</p>



<h3><i>NOT CORRELATED WITH MEAGERNESS OF LANGUAGE.</i></h3>

<p>The story has been told by travelers in many parts of the world that
various languages cannot be clearly understood in the dark by their
possessors, using their mother tongue between themselves. The evidence
for this anywhere is suspicious; and when it is asserted, as it often has
been, in reference to some of the tribes of North American Indians, it
is absolutely false, and must be attributed to the error of travelers who,
ignorant of the dialect, never see the natives except when trying to
make themselves intelligible to their visitors by a practice which they
have found by experience to have been successful with strangers to
their tongue, or perhaps when they are guarding against being overheard by
others. Captain Burton, in his <i>City of the Saints</i>, specially
states that the Arapahos possess a very scanty vocabulary, pronounced
in a quasi-unintelligible way, and can hardly converse with one another
in the dark. The truth is that their vocabulary is by no means scanty,
and they do converse with each other with perfect freedom without any
gestures when they so please. The difficulty in speaking or understanding
their language is in the large number of guttural and interrupted
sounds which are not helped by external motions of the mouth and lips
in articulation, and the light gives little advantage to its comprehension
so far as concerns the vocal apparatus, which, in many languages,
can be seen as well as heard, as is proved by the modern deaf-mute
practice of artificial speech. The corresponding story that no white
man ever learned Arapaho is also false. A member of Fr&#233;mont's party
so long ago as 1842 spoke the language. Burton in the same connection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[pg 315]</span>
gives a story "of a man who, being sent among the Cheyennes to qualify
himself for interpreting, returned in a week and proved his competency;
all he did, however, was to go through the usual pantomime with
a running accompaniment of grunts." And he might as well have
omitted the grunts, for he obviously only used sign language. Lieutenant
Abert, in 1846-'47, made much more sensible remarks from his
actual observation than Captain Burton repeated at second-hand from
a Mormon met by him at Salt Lake. He said: "Some persons think
that it [the Cheyenne language] would be incomplete without gesture,
because the Indians use gestures constantly. But I have been assured
that the language is in itself capable of bodying forth any idea to which
one may wish to give utterance."</p>

<p>In fact, individuals of those American tribes specially instanced in
these reports as unable to converse without gesture, often, in their
domestic <i>abandon</i>, wrap themselves up in robes or blankets with only
breathing holes before the nose, so that no part of the body is seen, and
chatter away for hours, telling long stories. If in daylight they thus
voluntarily deprive themselves of the possibility of making signs, it is
clear that their preference for talks around the fire at night is
explicable
by very natural reasons wholly distinct from the one attributed. The
inference, once carelessly made from the free use of gesture by some of
the Shoshonian stock, that their tongue was too meager for use without
signs, is refuted by the now ascertained fact that their vocabulary is
remarkably copious and their parts of speech better differentiated than
those of many people on whom no such stigma has been affixed. The
proof of this was seen in the writer's experience, when Ouray, the head
chief of the Utes, was at Washington, in the early part of 1880, and
after an interview with the Secretary of the Interior made report of it
to the rest of the delegation who had not been present. He spoke without
pause in his own language for nearly an hour, in a monotone and
without a single gesture. The reason for this depressed manner was
undoubtedly because he was very sad at the result, involving loss of
land and change of home; but the fact remains that full information
was communicated on a complicated subject without the aid of a manual
sign, and also without even such change of inflection of voice as is
common among Europeans. All theories based upon the supposed poverty
of American languages must be abandoned.</p>

<p>The grievous accusation against foreign people that they have no
intelligible language is venerable and general. With the Greeks the
term &alpha;&gamma;&lambda;&omega;&sigma;&sigma;&omicron;&sigmaf;,
"tongueless," was used synonymous with
&beta;&alpha;&rho;&beta;&alpha;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;,
"barbarian" of all who were not Greek. The name "Slav," assumed by a
grand division of the Aryan family, means "the speaker," and is
contradistinguished from the other peoples of the world, such as the Germans,
who are called in Russian "Njemez," that is, "speechless." In
Isaiah (xxxiii, 19) the Assyrians are called a people "of a stammering
tongue, that one cannot understand." The common use of the expression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg 316]</span>
"tongueless" and "speechless," so applied, has probably given rise,
as <span class="sc">Tylor</span> suggests, to the mythical stories of actually speechless tribes of
savages, and the considerations and instances above presented tend
to discredit the many other accounts of languages which are incomplete
without the help of gesture. The theory that sign language was in
whole or in chief the original utterance of mankind would be strongly
supported by conclusive evidence to the truth of such travelers' tales,
but does not depend upon them. Nor, considering the immeasurable
period during which, in accordance with modern geologic views, man
has been on the earth, is it probable that any existing races can be found
in which speech has not obviated the absolute necessity for gesture in
communication among themselves. The signs survive for convenience,
used together with oral language, and for special employment when
language is unavailable.</p>

<p>A comparison sometimes drawn between sign language and that of
our Indians, founded on the statement of their common poverty in abstract
expressions, is not just to either. This paper will be written in
vain if it shall not suggest the capacities of gesture speech in that
regard, and a deeper study into Indian tongues has shown that they are by no
means so confined to the concrete as was once believed.</p>



<h3><i>ITS ORIGIN FROM ONE TRIBE OR REGION.</i></h3>

<p>Col. Richard I. Dodge, United States Army, whose long experience
among the Indians entitles his opinion to great respect, says in a letter:</p>

<p>"The embodiment of signs into a systematic language is, I believe,
confined to the Indians of the Plains. Contiguous tribes gain, here and
there, a greater or less knowledge of this language; these again extend
the knowledge, diminished and probably perverted, to their neighbors,
until almost all the Indian tribes of the United States east of the Sierras
have some little smattering of it. The Plains Indians believe the
Kiowas to have invented the sign language, and that by them its use was
communicated to other Plains tribes. If this is correct, analogy would
lead us to believe that those tribes most nearly in contact with the
Kiowas would use it most fluently and correctly, the knowledge becoming
less as the contact diminishes. Thus the Utes, though nearly contiguous
(in territory) to the Plains Indians, have only the merest 'picked
up' knowledge of this language, and never use it among themselves,
simply because, they and the Plains tribes having been, since the memory
of their oldest men, in a chronic state of war, there has been no social
contact."</p>

<p>In another communication Colonel Dodge is still more definite:</p>

<p>"The Plains Indians themselves believe the sign language was invented
by the Kiowas, who holding an intermediate position between the
Comanches, Tonkaways, Lipans, and other inhabitants of the vast plains
of Texas, and the Pawnees, Sioux, Blackfeet, and other northern tribes,
were the general go-betweens, trading with all, making peace or war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[pg 317]</span>
with or for any or all. It is certain that the Kiowas are at present
more universally proficient in this language than any other Plains tribe.
It is also certain that the tribes farthest away from them and with
whom they have least intercourse use it with least facility."</p>

<p>Dr. William H. Corbusier, assistant surgeon United States Army, a
valued contributor, gives information as follows:</p>

<p>"The traditions of the Indians point toward the south as the direction
from which the sign language came. They refer to the time when
they did not use it; and each tribe say they learned it from those south
of them. The Comanches, who acquired it in Mexico, taught it to the
Arapahoes and Kiowas, and from these the Cheyennes learned it. The
Sioux say that they had no knowledge of it before they crossed the Missouri
River and came in contact with the Cheyennes, but have quite
recently learned it from them. It would thus appear that the Plains Indians
did not invent it, but finding it adapted to their wants adopted it
as a convenient means of communicating with those whose language
they did not understand, and it rapidly spread from tribe to tribe over
the Plains. As the sign language came from Mexico, the Spaniards
suggest themselves as the introducers of it on this continent. They are
adepts in the use of signs. Cortez as he marched through Mexico
would naturally have resorted to signs in communicating with the numerous
tribes with which he came in contract. Finding them very necessary,
one sign after another would suggest itself and be adopted by
Spaniards and Indians, and, as the former advanced, one tribe after
another would learn to use them. The Indians on the Plains, finding
them so useful, preserved them and each tribe modified them to suit
their convenience, but the signs remained essentially the same. The
Shoshones took the sign language with them as they moved northwest,
and a few of the Piutes may have learned it from them, but the Piutes
as a tribe do not use it."</p>

<p>Mr. Ben. Clarke, the respected and skillful interpreter at Fort Reno
writes to the same general effect:</p>

<p>"The Cheyennes think that the sign language used by the Cheyennes,
Arapahoes, Ogallala and Brul&#233; Sioux, Kiowas, and Comanches
originated with the Kiowas. It is a tradition that, many years ago,
when the Northern Indians were still without horses, the Kiowas
often raided among the Mexican Indians and captured droves of horses
on these trips. The Northern Plains Indians used to journey to them
and trade for horses. The Kiowas were already proficient in signs, and
the others learned from them. It was the journeying to the South that
finally divided the Cheyennes, making the Northern and Southern
Cheyennes. The same may be said of the Arapahoes. That the Kiowas
were the first sign talkers is only a tradition, but as a tribe they
are now considered to be the best or most thorough of the Plains Indians."</p>

<p>Without engaging in any controversy on this subject it may be noticed
that the theory advanced supposes a comparatively recent origin of sign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>[pg 318]</span>
language from one tribe and one region, whereas, so far as can be traced,
the conditions favorable to a sign language existed very long ago and
were co-extensive with the territory of North America occupied by any
of the tribes. To avoid repetition reference is made to the discussion
below under the heads of universality, antiquity, identity, and permanence.
At this point it is only desired to call attention to the ancient
prevalence of signs among tribes such as the Iroquois, Wyandot, Ojibwa,
and at least three generations back among the Crees beyond our northern
boundary and the Mandans and other far-northern Dakotas, not
likely at that time to have had communication, even through intertribal
channels, with the Kaiowas. It is also difficult to understand how
their signs would have in that manner reached the Kutchin of Eastern
Alaska and the Kutine and Selish of British Columbia, who use signs
now. At the same time due consideration must be given to the great
change in the intercommunication of tribes, produced by the importation
of the horse, by which the habits of those Indians now, but not very
anciently, inhabiting the Plains were entirely changed. It is probable
that a sign language before existing became, contemporaneously with
nomadic life, cultivated and enriched.</p>

<p>As regards the Spanish origin suggested, there is ample evidence that
the Spaniards met signs in their early explorations north of and in the
northern parts of Mexico, and availed themselves of them but did not
introduce them. It is believed also that the elaborate picture writing
of Mexico was founded on gesture signs.</p>

<p>With reference to the statement that the Kaiowas are the most expert
sign talkers of the Plains, a number of authorities and correspondents
give the precedence to the Cheyennes, and an equal number to the
Arapahos. Probably the accident of meeting specially skillful talkers
in the several tribes visited influences such opinions.</p>

<p>The writer's experience, both of the Utes and Pai-Utes, is different from
the above statement respecting the absence of signs among them. They
not only use their own signs but fully understand the difference between
the signs regarded as their own and those of the Kaiowas. On
special examination they understood some of the latter only as words
of a foreign language interpolated in an oral conversation would be
comprehended from the context, and others they would recognize as
having seen before among other tribes without adoption. The same is
true regarding the Brul&#233; Sioux, as was clearly expressed by Medicine
Bull, their chief. The Pimas, Papagos, and Maricopas examined had a
copious sign language, yet were not familiar with many Kaiowa signs
presented to them.</p>

<p>Instead of referring to a time past when they did not use signs, the
Indians examined by the writer and by most of his correspondents
speak of a time when they and their fathers used it more freely and
copiously than at present, its disuse being from causes before mentioned.
It, however, may be true in some cases that a tribe, having been for a
long time in contact only with others the dialect of which was so nearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>[pg 319]</span>
akin as to be comprehensible, or from any reason being separated from
those of a strange speech, discontinued sign language for a time, and then
upon migration or forced removal came into circumstances where it was
useful, and revived it. It is asserted that some of the Muskoki and the
Ponkas now in the Indian Territory never saw sign language until they
arrived there. Yet there is some evidence that the Muskoki did use
signs a century ago, and some of the Ponkas still remaining on their old
homes on the Missouri remember it and have given their knowledge to
an accurate correspondent, Rev. J.O. Dorsey, though for many years
they have not been in circumstances to require its employment.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most salutary criticism to be offered regarding the theory
would
be in the form of a query whether sign language has ever been invented
by any one body of people at any one time, and whether it is not
simply a phase in evolution, surviving and reviving when needed. Criticism
on this subject is made reluctantly, as it would be highly interesting
to determine that sign language on this continent came from a particular
stock, and to ascertain that stock. Such research would be similar
to that into the Aryan and Semitic sources to which many modern
languages have been traced backwards from existing varieties, and if
there appear to be existing varieties in signs their roots may still be
found to be <i>sui generis</i>. The possibility that the discrepancy
between
signs was formerly greater than at present will receive attention in
discussing
the distinction between the identity of signs and their common
use as an art. It is sufficient to add now that not only does the burden
of proof rest unfavorably upon the attempt to establish one parent
stock for sign language in North America, but it also comes under the
stigma now fastened upon the immemorial effort to name and locate the
original oral speech of man. It is only next in difficulty to the old
persistent
determination to decide upon the origin of the whole Indian
"race," in which most peoples of antiquity in the eastern hemisphere,
including
the lost tribes of Israel, the Gipsies, and the Welsh, have figured
conspicuously as putative parents.</p>



<h3><i>IS THE INDIAN SYSTEM SPECIAL AND PECULIAR?</i></h3>

<p>This inquiry is closely connected with the last. If the system of signs
was invented here in the correct sense of that term, and by a known and
existing tribe, it is probable that it would not be found prevailing in
any important degree where the influence of the inventors could not
readily have penetrated. An affirmative answer to the question also
presupposes
the same answer to another question, viz, whether there is any
one uniform system among the North American Indians which can therefore
be compared with any other system. This last inquiry will be considered
in its order. In comparing the system as a whole with others,
the latter are naturally divided into signs of speaking men foreign to
America and those of deaf-mutes.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[pg 320]</span>


<h4>COMPARISONS WITH FOREIGN SIGNS.</h4>

<p>The generalization of <span class="sc">Tylor</span> that "gesture language is substantially
the same among savage tribes all over the world," interpreted by his
remarks in another connection, is understood as referring to their common
use of signs, and of signs formed on the same principles, but not
of precisely the same signs to express the same ideas. In this sense of
the generalization the result of the writer's study not only sustains it,
but shows a surprising number of signs for the same idea which are
substantially
identical, not only among savage tribes, but among all peoples
that use gesture signs with any freedom. Men, in groping for a
mode of communication with each other, and using the same general
methods, have been under many varying conditions and circumstances
which have determined differently many conceptions and their semiotic
execution, but there have also been many of both which were similar.
Our Indians have no special superstition concerning the evil-eye like
the Italians, nor have they been long familiar with the jackass so as to
make him emblematical of stupidity; therefore signs for these concepts
are not cisatlantic, but even in this paper many are shown which are
substantially in common between our Indians and Italians. The large
collection already obtained, but not now published, shows many others
identical, not only with those of the Italians and the classic Greeks and
Romans, but of other peoples of the Old World, both savage and civilized.
The generic uniformity is obvious, while the occasion of specific
varieties can be readily understood.</p>


<h4>COMPARISON WITH DEAF-MUTE SIGNS.</h4>

<p>The Indians who have been shown over the civilized East have often
succeeded in holding intercourse, by means of their invention and
application
of principles in what may be called the voiceless mother utterance,
with white deaf-mutes, who surely have no semiotic code more
nearly connected with that attributed to the plain-roamers than is derived
from their common humanity. They showed the greatest pleasure
in meeting deaf-mutes, precisely as travelers in a foreign country are
rejoiced to meet persons speaking their language, with whom they can
hold direct communication without the tiresome and often suspected
medium of an interpreter. When they met together they were found to
pursue the same course as that noticed at the meeting of deaf-mutes
who were either not instructed in any methodical dialect or who had
received such instruction by different methods. They often disagreed
in the signs at first presented, but soon understood them, and finished
by adopting some in mutual compromise, which proved to be those most
strikingly appropriate, graceful, and convenient; but there still remained
in some cases a plurality of fitting signs for the same idea or
object. On one of the most interesting of these occasions, at the
Pennsylvania
Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, in 1873, it was remarked
that the signs of the deaf-mutes were much more readily understood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>[pg 321]</span>
by the Indians, who were Absaroka or Crows, Arapahos, and Cheyennes,
than were theirs by the deaf-mutes, and that the latter greatly excelled
in pantomimic effect. This need not be surprising when it is considered
that what is to the Indian a mere adjunct or accomplishment is to the
deaf-mute the natural mode of utterance, and that there is still greater
freedom from the trammel of translating words into action&mdash;instead of
acting the ideas themselves&mdash;when, the sound of words being unknown,
they remain still as they originated, but another kind of sign, even
after the art of reading is acquired, and do not become entities as with
us. The "action, action, action," of Demosthenes is their only oratory,
not the mere heightening of it, however valuable.</p>

<p>On March 6, 1880, the writer had an interesting experience in taking
to the National Deaf-Mute College at Washington seven Utes (which
tribe, according to report, is unacquainted with sign language), among whom
were Augustin, Alejandro, Jakonik, Severio, and Wash. By the kind attention
of President <span class="sc">Gallaudet</span> a thorough test was given,
an equal number of deaf-mute pupils being placed in communication
with the Indians, alternating with them both in making individual signs
and in telling narratives in gesture, which were afterwards interpreted
in speech by the Ute interpreter and the officers of the college. Notes of
a few of them were taken, as follows:</p>

<p>Among the signs was that for <i>squirrel</i>, given by a deaf-mute. The
right hand was placed over and facing the left, and about four inches
above the latter, to show the height of the animal; then the two hands were
held edgewise and horizontally in front, about eight inches apart (showing
<i>length</i>); then imitating the grasping of a small object and
biting it rapidly with the incisors, the extended index was pointed
upward and forward (<i>in a tree</i>).</p>

<p>This was not understood, as the Utes have no sign for the tree squirrel,
the arboreal animal not being now found in their region.</p>

<p>Deaf-mute sign for <i>jack-rabbit</i>: The first two fingers of each hand
extended (the remaining fingers and thumbs closed) were placed on either
side of the head, pointing upward; then arching the hands, palm down,
quick, interrupted, jumping movements forward were made.</p>

<p>This was readily understood.</p>

<p>The signs for the following narrative were given by a deaf-mute:
When he was a boy he mounted a horse without either bridle or saddle,
and as the horse began to go he grasped him by the neck for support; a dog
flew at the horse, began to bark, when the rider was thrown off and
considerably hurt.</p>

<p>In this the sign for <i>dog</i> was as follows: Pass the arched hand
forward from the lower part of the face, to illustrate elongated nose and
mouth, then with both forefingers extended, remaining fingers and thumbs
closed, place them upon either side of the lower jaw, pointing upward,
to show lower canines, at the same time accompanying the gesture with
an expression of withdrawing the lips so as to show the teeth snarling;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>[pg 322]</span>
then, with the fingers of the right hand extended and separated throw
them quickly forward and slightly upward (<i>voice</i> or <i>talking</i>).</p>

<p>This sign was understood to mean <i>bear</i>, as that for <i>dog</i> is
different
among the Utes, <i>i.e.</i>, by merely showing the height of the dog and
pushing the flat hand forward, finger-tips first.</p>

<p>Another deaf-mute gestured to tell that when he was a boy he went
to a melon-field, tapped several melons, finding them to be green or
unripe;
finally reaching a good one he took his knife, cut a slice, and ate
it. A man made his appearance on horseback, entered the patch on
foot, found the cut melon, and detecting the thief, threw the melon towards
him, hitting him in the back, whereupon he ran away crying. The
man mounted and rode off in an opposite direction.</p>

<p>All of these signs were readily comprehended, although some of the
Indians varied very slightly in their translation.</p>

<p>When the Indians were asked whether, if they (the deaf-mutes) were
to come to the Ute country they would be scalped, the answer was given,
"Nothing would be done to you; but we would be friends," as follows:</p>

<p>The palm of the right hand was brushed toward the right over that
of the left (<i>nothing</i>), and the right hand made to grasp the palm of
the left,
thumbs extended over and lying upon the back of the opposing hand.</p>

<p>This was readily understood by the deaf-mutes.</p>

<p>Deaf-mute sign of milking a cow and drinking the milk was fully and
quickly understood.</p>

<p>The narrative of a boy going to an apple-tree, hunting for ripe fruit
and filling his pockets, being surprised by the owner and hit upon the
head with a stone, was much appreciated by the Indians and completely
understood.</p>

<p>A deaf-mute asked Alejandro how long it took him to come to Washington
from his country. He replied by placing the index and second
finger of the right hand astride the extended forefinger (others closed)
of the left; then elevating the fingers of the left hand (except thumb
and forefinger) back forward (<i>three</i>); then extending the fingers of
both
hands and bringing them to a point, thumbs resting on palmar sides and
extended, placing the hands in front of the body, the tips opposite the
opposing wrist, and about four inches apart; then, revolving them in
imitation of <i>wheels</i>, he elevated the extended forefinger of the left
hand (<i>one</i>); then placing the extended flat hands, thumbs touching,
the backs sloping downward towards the respective right and left
sides, like the roof of a house; then repeating the sign of wheels as in
the preceding, after which the left hand was extended before the body,
fingers toward the right, horizontal, palm down and slightly arched,
the right wrist held under it, the fingers extending upward beyond it,
and quickly and repeatedly snapped upward (<i>smoke</i>); the last three
signs
being <i>covered&mdash;wagon&mdash;smoke</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>cars</i>; then elevating four fingers
of the left hand (<i>four</i>).</p>

<p><i>Translation</i>.&mdash;Traveled three days on horseback, one in a wagon, and
four in the cars.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[pg 323]</span>

<p>The deaf-mutes understood all but the sign for wheel, which they
make as a large circle, with <i>one</i> hand.</p>

<p>Another example: A deaf-mute pretended to hunt something; found
birds, took his bow and arrows and killed several.</p>

<p>This was fully understood.</p>

<p>A narrative given by Alejandro was also understood by the deaf-mutes,
to the effect that he made search for deer, shot one with a gun,
killed and skinned it, and packed it up.</p>

<p>It will be observed that many of the above signs admitted of and were
expressed by pantomime, yet that was not the case with all that were
made. President <span class="sc">Gallaudet</span> made also some remarks in gesture which
were understood by the Indians, yet were not strictly pantomimic.</p>

<p>The opinion of all present at the test was that two intelligent mimes
would seldom fail of mutual understanding, their attention being
exclusively directed to the expression of thoughts by the means of
comprehension and reply equally possessed by both, without the mental
confusion of conventional sounds only intelligible to one.</p>

<p>A large collection has been made of natural deaf-mute signs, and also
of those more conventional, which have been collated with those of the
several tribes of Indians. Many of them show marked similarity, not
only in principle but often in detail.</p>

<hr />

<p>The result of the studies so far as prosecuted is that what is called
<i>the</i> sign language of Indians is not, properly speaking, one
language,
but that it and the gesture systems of deaf-mutes and of all peoples
constitute together one language&mdash;the gesture speech of mankind&mdash;of
which each system is a dialect.</p>



<h3><i>TO WHAT EXTENT PREVALENT AS A SYSTEM.</i></h3>

<p>The assertion has been made by many writers, and is currently repeated
by Indian traders and some Army officers, that all the tribes of
North America have long had and still use a <i>common</i> and
<i>identical</i> sign
language, in which they can communicate freely without oral assistance.
Although this remarkable statement is at variance with some of the
principles of the formation and use of signs set forth by Dr. <span class="sc">E.B. Tylor</span>,
whose admirable chapters on gesture speech in his <i>Researches into the
Early History of Mankind</i> have in a great degree prompted the
present inquiries, that eminent authority did not see fit to discredit it.
He repeats the report as he received it, in the words that "the same
signs serve as a medium of converse from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of
Mexico." Its truth or falsity can only be established by careful comparison
of lists or vocabularies of signs taken under test conditions at
widely different times and places. For this purpose lists have been
collated by the writer, taken in different parts of the country at several
dates, from the last century to the last month, comprising together several
thousand signs, many of them, however, being mere variants or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>[pg 324]</span>
synonyms for the same object or quality, some being repetitions of
others and some of small value from uncertainty in description or
authority, or both.</p>


<h4>ONCE PROBABLY UNIVERSAL IN NORTH AMERICA.</h4>

<p>The conclusion reached from the researches made is to the effect that
before the changes wrought by the Columbian discovery the use of gesture
illustrated the remark of Quintilian upon the same subject (l. xi, c. 3)
that "<i>In tanta per omnes gentes nationesque lingu&#230; diversitate hic mihi
omnium hominum communis sermo videatur</i>."</p>

<p>Quotations may be taken from some old authorities referring to widely
separated regions. The Indians of Tampa Bay, identified with the Timucua,
met by Cabe&#231;a de Vaca in 1528, were active in the use of signs,
and in his journeying for eight subsequent years, probably through
Texas and Mexico, he remarks that he passed through many dissimilar
tongues, but that he questioned and received the answers of the Indians by
signs "just as if they spoke our language and we theirs." Micha&#235;lius,
writing in 1628, says of the Algonkins on or near the Hudson River: "For
purposes of trading as much was done by signs with the thumb and fingers as
by speaking." In Bossu's <i>Travels through that part of North America
formerly called Louisiana</i>, <i>London</i>, 1771 (Forster's translation),
an account is given of Monsieur de Belle-Isle some years previously
captured by the
Atak-apa, who remained with them two years and "conversed in their
pantomimes with them." He was rescued by Governor Bienville and was
sufficiently expert in the sign language to interpret between Bienville and
the tribe. In Bushmann's <i>Spuren</i>, p. 424,
there is a reference to the "Accocessaws on the west side of the Colorado,
two hundred miles southwest of Nacogdoches," who use thumb signs which they
understand: "<i>Theilen sich aber auch durch
Daum-Zeichen mit, die sie alle verstehen.</i>"</p>

<p>Omitting many authorities, and for brevity allowing a break in the
continuity
of time, reference may be made to the statement in Major Long's
expedition of 1819, concerning the Arapahos, Kaiowas, Ietans, and
Cheyennes, to the effect that, being ignorant of each other's languages,
many of them when they met would communicate by means of signs,
and would thus maintain a conversation without the least difficulty or
interruption. A list of the tribes reported upon by Prince Maximilian
von Wied-Neuweid, in 1832-'34, appears elsewhere in this paper. In
Fr&#233;mont's expedition of 1844 special and repeated allusion is made to
the expertness of the Pai-Utes in signs, which is contradictory to the
statement above made by correspondents. The same is mentioned regarding a
band of Shoshonis met near the summit of the Sierra Nevada, and one of
"Diggers," probably Chemehuevas, encountered on a tributary of the Rio
Virgen.</p>

<p>Ruxton, in his <i>Adventures in Mexico and the Rocky Mountains</i>, <i>New
York</i>, 1848, p. 278, sums up his experience with regard to the Western
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>[pg 325]</span>
tribes so well as to require quotation: "The language of signs is so
perfectly understood in the Western country, and the Indians themselves
are such admirable pantomimists, that, after a little use, no difficulty
whatever exists in carrying on a conversation by such a channel; and
there are few mountain men who are at a loss in thoroughly understanding
and making themselves intelligible by signs alone, although they
neither speak nor understand a word of the Indian tongue."</p>

<p>Passing to the correspondents of the writer from remote parts of
North America, it is important to notice that Mr. J.W. Powell, Indian
superintendent, reports the use of sign language among the Kutine, and
Mr. James Lenihan, Indian agent, among the Selish, both tribes of
British Columbia. The Very Rev. Edward Jacker, while contributing
information
upon the present use of gesture language among the Ojibwas of
Lake Superior, mentions that it has fallen into comparative neglect because
for three generations they had not been in contact with tribes of a
different
speech. Dr. Francis H. Atkins, acting assistant surgeon, United
States Army, in forwarding a contribution of signs of the Mescalero
Apaches remarks: "I think it probable that they have used sign language
rather less than many other Indians. They do not seem to use
it to any extent at home, and abroad the only tribes they were likely
to come into contact with were the Navajos, the Lipans of old Mexico,
and the Comanches. Probably the last have been almost alone their
visiting neighbors. They have also seen the Pueblos a little, these
appearing
to be, like the Ph&oelig;nicians of old, the traders of this region." He also
alludes to the effect of the Spanish, or rather <i>lingua Mexicana</i>,
upon all the Southern tribes and, indeed, upon those as far north as
the Utes, by which recourse to signs is now rendered less necessary.</p>

<p>Before leaving this particular topic it is proper to admit that, while
there is not only recorded testimony to the past use of gesture signs by
several tribes of the Iroquoian and Algonkian families, but evidence
that it still remains, it is, however, noticeable that these families when
met by their first visitors do not appear to have often impressed the
latter with their reliance upon gesture language to the same extent as
has always been reported of the tribes now and formerly found farther
inland. An explanation may be suggested from the fact that among
those families there were more people dwelling near together in communities
speaking the same language, though with dialectic peculiarities, than
became known later in the farther West, and not being nomadic their
intercourse with strange tribes was less individual and conversational.
Some of the tribes, in especial the Iroquois proper, were in a
comparatively
advanced social condition. A Mohawk or Seneca would probably have
repeated the arrogance of the old Romans, whom in other respects they
resembled, and compelled persons of inferior tribes to learn his language
if they desired to converse with him, instead of resorting to the
compromise
of gesture speech, which he had practiced before the prowess and policy of
the confederated Five Nations had gained supremacy and which
was still used for special purposes between the members of his own tribe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>[pg 326]</span>
The studies thus far pursued lead to the conclusion that at the time
of the discovery of North America all its inhabitants practiced sign
language, though with different degrees of expertness, and that while
under changed circumstances it was disused by some, others, in especial
those who after the acquisition of horses became nomads of the Great
Plains, retained and cultivated it to the high development now attained,
from which it will surely and speedily decay.</p>


<h4>MISTAKEN DENIAL THAT SIGN LANGUAGE EXISTS.</h4>

<p>The most useful suggestion to persons interested in the collection
of signs is that they shall not too readily abandon the attempt to discover
recollections of them even among tribes long exposed to European
influence and officially segregated from others. The instances where
their existence, at first denied, has been ascertained are important with
reference to the theories advanced.</p>

<p>Rev. J. Owen Dorsey has furnished a considerable vocabulary of signs
finally procured from the Poncas, although, after residing among them
for years, with thorough familiarity with their language, and after special
and intelligent exertion to obtain some of their disused gesture language,
he had before reported it to be entirely forgotten. A similar report was
made by two missionaries among the Ojibwas, though other trustworthy
authorities have furnished a copious list of signs obtained from that
tribe. This is no imputation against the missionaries, as in October,
1880, five intelligent Ojibwas from Petoskey, Mich., told the writer that
they had never heard of gesture language. An interesting letter from
Mr. B.O. Williams, sr., of Owasso, Mich., explains the gradual decadence
of signs used by the Ojibwas in his recollection, embracing sixty years,
as chiefly arising from general acquaintance with the English language.
Further discouragement came from an Indian agent giving the decided
statement, after four years of intercourse with the Pai-Utes, that no
such thing as a communication by signs was known or even remembered
by them, which, however, was less difficult to bear because on the day of
the receipt of that well-intentioned missive some officers of the Bureau
of Ethnology were actually talking in signs with a delegation of that
very tribe of Indians then in Washington, from one of whom, N&#225;tci, a
narrative printed in this paper (page <a href="#page500">500</a>), was received.</p>

<p>The report from missionaries, army officers, and travelers in Alaska
was unanimous against the existence of a sign language there until Mr.
Ivan Petroff, whose explorations had been more extensive, gave the
excellent exposition and dialogue now produced (see page <a href="#page492">492</a>). Collections
were also obtained from the Apaches and Zu&#241;i, Pimas, Papagos,
and Maricopas, after agents and travelers had denied them to be possessed
of any knowledge on the subject.</p>

<p>For the reasons mentioned under the last heading, little hope was
entertained of procuring a collection from any of the Iroquoian stock, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>[pg 327]</span>
the intelligent and respectable chief of the Wyandots, H&#233;nto (Gray Eyes),
came to the rescue. His tribe was moved from Ohio in July, 1843, to
the territory now occupied by the State of Kansas, and then again
moved to Indian Territory, in 1870. He asserts that about one-third of the
tribe, the older portion, know many signs, a partial list of which he gave
with their descriptions. He was sure that those signs were used before the
removal from Ohio, and he saw them used also by Shawnees, Delawares, and
Senecas there.</p>

<p>Unanimous denial of any existence of sign language came from the
British provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and was followed by the collection
obtained by the Hon. Horatio Hale. His statement of the time
and manner of its being procured by him is not only interesting but
highly instructive:</p>

<p>"The aged Mohawk chief, from whom the information on this subject
has been obtained, is commonly known by his English name of John
Smoke Johnson. 'Smoke' is a rude version of his Indian name,
<i>Sakayenkwaraton</i>, which may be rendered 'Disappearing Mist.' It is
the term applied to the haze which rises in the morning of an autumn day,
and gradually passes away. Chief Johnson has been for many years 'speaker'
of the great council of the Six Nations. In former times he was noted as a
warrior, and later has been esteemed one of the most eloquent orators of
his race. At the age of eighty-eight years he retains much of his original
energy. He is considered to have a better knowledge of the traditions and
ancient customs of his people than any other person now living. This
superior knowledge was strikingly apparent in the course of the
investigations which were made respecting the sign language. Two other
members of his tribe, well-educated and
very intelligent men of middle age, the one a chief and government
interpreter,
the other a clergyman now settled over a white congregation,
had both been consulted on the subject and both expressed the opinion
that nothing of the sign language, properly speaking, was known among
the Six Nations. They were alike surprised and interested when the old
chief, in their presence, after much consideration, gradually drew forth
from the stores of his memory the proofs of an accomplishment which
had probably lain unused for more than half a century."</p>

<p>One of the most conclusive instances of the general knowledge of sign
language, even when seldom used, was shown in the visit of five Jicarilla
Apaches to Washington in April, 1880, under the charge of Dr. Benjamin
Thomas, their agent. The latter said he had never heard of any
use of signs among them. But it happened that there was a delegation
of Absaroka (Crows) at the same hotel, and the two parties from
such widely separated regions, not knowing a word of each other's language,
immediately began to converse in signs, resulting in a decided sensation.
One of the Crows asked the Apaches whether they ate horses, and it
happening that the sign for <i>eating</i> was misapprehended for that known
by the Apaches for <i>many</i>, the question was supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>[pg 328]</span>
to be whether the latter had many horses, which was answered in the
affirmative. Thence ensued a misunderstanding on the subject of hippophagy,
which was curious both as showing the general use of signs as a practice
and the diversity in special signs for particular meanings. The surprise of
the agent at the unsuspected accomplishment of his charges was not unlike
that of a hen who, having hatched a number of duck eggs, is perplexed at
the instinct with which the brood takes to the water.</p>

<p>The denial of the use of signs is often faithfully though erroneously
reported from the distinct statements of Indians to that effect. In that,
as in other matters, they are often provokingly reticent about their old
habits and traditions. Chief Ouray asserted to the writer, as he also did
to Colonel Dodge, that his people, the Utes, had not the practice of sign
talk, and had no use for it. This was much in the proud spirit in
which an Englishman would have made the same statement, as the idea
involved an accusation against the civilization of his people, which he
wished to appear highly advanced. Still more frequently the Indians do not
distinctly comprehend what is sought to be obtained. Sometimes, also, the
art, abandoned in general, only remains in the memories of a few persons
influenced by special circumstances or individual fancy.</p>

<p>In this latter regard a comparison may be made with the old science
of heraldry, once of practical use and a necessary part of a liberal
education,
of which hardly a score of persons in the United States have
any but the vague knowledge that it once existed; yet the united memories
of those persons could, in the absence of records, reproduce all
essential points on the subject.</p>

<p>Another cause for the mistaken denial in question must be mentioned.
When travelers or sojourners have become acquainted with signs in any
one place they may assume that those signs constitute <i>the</i> sign
language,
and if they afterwards meet tribes not at once recognizing those signs,
they remove all difficulty about the theory of a "one and indivisible"
sign language by simply asserting that the tribes so met do not understand
<i>the</i> sign language, or perhaps that they do not use signs at all.
This precise assertion has, as above mentioned, been made regarding the
Utes and Apaches. Of course, also, Indians who have not been
brought into sufficient contact with certain tribes using different signs,
for the actual trial which would probably result in mutual comprehension,
tell the travelers the same story. It is the venerable one of
"&alpha;&gamma;&lambda;&omega;&sigma;&sigma;&omicron;&sigmaf;,"
"Njemez," "barbarian," and "stammering," above noted,
applied to the hands instead of the tongue. Thus an observer possessed
by a restrictive theory will find no signs where they are in plenty, while
another determined on the universality and identity of sign language
can, as elsewhere explained, produce, from perhaps the same individuals,
evidence in his favor from the apparently conclusive result of
successful communication.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>[pg 329]</span>


<h4>PERMANENCE OF SIGNS.</h4>

<p>In connection with any theory it is important to inquire into the
permanence
of particular gesture signs to express a special idea or object
when the system has been long continued. Many examples have been
given above showing that the gestures of classic times are still in use
by the modern Italians with the same signification; indeed that the
former on Greek vases or reliefs or in Herculanean bronzes can only be
interpreted by the latter. In regard to the signs of instructed deaf-mutes
in this country there appears to be a permanence beyond expectation.
Mr. Edmund Booth, a pupil of the Hartford Institute half a century
ago, and afterwards a teacher, says in the "<i>Annals</i>" for April,
1880, that the signs used by teachers and pupils at Hartford, Philadelphia,
Washington, Council Bluffs, and Omaha were nearly the same as
he had learned. "We still adhere to the old sign for President from
Monroe's three-cornered hat, and for governor we designate the cockade
worn by that dignitary on grand occasions three generations ago."</p>

<p>The specific comparisons made, especially by Dr. Washington Matthews
and Dr. W.O. Boteler, of the signs reported by the Prince of Wied in
1832 with those now used by the same tribes from whom he obtained
them, show a remarkable degree of permanency in many of those that
were so clearly described by the Prince as to be proper subjects of any
comparison. If they have persisted for half a century their age is probably
much greater. In general it is believed that signs, constituting as
they do a natural mode of expression, though enlarging in scope as new
ideas and new objects require to be included and though abbreviated as
hereinafter explained, do not readily change in their essentials.</p>

<p>The writer has before been careful to explain that he does not present
any signs as precisely those of primitive man, not being so carried away
by enthusiasm as to suppose them possessed of immutability and immortality
not found in any other mode of human utterance. Yet such signs
as are generally prevalent among Indian tribes, and also in other parts
of the world, must be of great antiquity. The use of derivative meanings
to a sign only enhances this presumption. At first there might
not appear to be any connection between the ideas of <i>same</i> and
<i>wife</i>,
expressed by the sign of horizontally extending the two forefingers side
by side. The original idea was doubtless that given by the Welsh captain
in Shakspere's Henry V: "'Tis so like as my fingers is to my
fingers," and from this similarity comes "equal," "companion," and
subsequently the close life-companion "wife." The sign is used in each
of these senses by different Indian tribes, and sometimes the same tribe
applies it in all of the senses as the context determines. It appears also
in many lands with all the significations except that of "wife." It is
proper here to mention that the suggestion of several correspondents
that the Indian sign as applied to "wife" refers to "lying together" is
rendered improbable by the fact that when the same tribes desire to
express the sexual relation of marriage it is gestured otherwise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>[pg 330]</span>
Many signs but little differentiated were unstable, while others that
have proved the best modes of expression have survived as definite and
established. Their prevalence and permanence being mainly determined by the
experience of their utility, it would be highly interesting to ascertain
how long a time was required for a distinctly new conception or
execution to gain currency, become "the fashion," so to speak, over a
large part of the continent, and to be supplanted by a new "mode." A
note may be made in this connection of the large number of diverse
signs for <i>horse</i>, all of which must have been invented within a
comparatively
recent period, and the small variation in the signs for <i>dog</i>,
which are probably ancient.</p>


<h4>SURVIVAL IN GESTURE.</h4>

<p>Even when the specific practice of sign language has been generally
discontinued for more than one generation, either from the adoption
of a jargon or from the common use of the tongue of the conquering
English, French, or Spanish, some of the gestures formerly employed as
substitutes for words may survive as a customary accompaniment to oratory
or impassioned conversation, and, when ascertained, should be carefully
noted. An example, among many, may be found in the fact that
the now civilized Muskoki or Creeks, as mentioned by Rev. H.F. Buckner,
when speaking of the height of children or women, illustrate their
words by holding their hands at the proper elevation, palm up; but
when describing the height of "soulless" animals or inanimate objects,
they hold the palm downward. This, when correlated with the distinctive
signs of other Indians, is an interesting case of the survival of a
practice which, so far as yet reported, the oldest men of the tribe, now
living only remember to have once existed. It is probable that a collection
of such distinctive gestures among the most civilized Indians
would reproduce enough of their ancient system to be valuable, while
possibly the persistent inquirer might in his search discover some of its
surviving custodians even among Chabta or Cheroki, Innuit or Abnaki,
Klamath or Nutka.</p>


<h4>DISTINCTION BETWEEN IDENTITY OF SIGNS AND THEIR USE AS AN ART.</h4>

<p>The general report that there is but one sign language in North America,
any deviation from which is either blunder, corruption, or a dialect in
the nature of provincialism, may be examined in reference to some of the
misconceived facts which gave it origin and credence. It may not appear
to be necessary that such examination should be directed to any mode of
collecting and comparing signs which would amount to their distortion.
It is useful, however, to explain that distortion would result from
following
the views of a recent essayist, who takes the ground that the description
of signs should be made according to a "mean" or average. There can be no
philosophic consideration of signs according to a "mean" of observations.
The proper object is to ascertain the radical or essential part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>[pg 331]</span>
as distinct from any individual flourish or mannerism on the one hand, and
from a conventional or accidental abbreviation on the other; but
a mere average will not accomplish that object. If the hand, being
in any position whatever, is, according to five observations, moved
horizontally one foot to the right, and, according to five other
observations,
moved one foot horizontally to the left, the "mean" or resultant
will be that it is stationary, which sign does not correspond
with any of the ten observations. So if six observations give it a
rapid motion of one foot to the right and five a rapid motion of the
same distance to the left, the mean or resultant would be somewhat
difficult to express, but perhaps would be a slow movement to the right
for an inch or two, having certainly no resemblance either in essentials
or accidents to any of the signs actually observed. In like manner
the tail of the written letter "<i>y</i>" (which, regarding its mere
formation,
might be a graphic sign) may have in the chirography of several
persons various degrees of slope, may be a straight line, or looped, and
may be curved on either side; but a "mean" taken from the several
manuscripts would leave the unfortunate letter without any tail whatever,
or travestied as a "<i>u</i>" with an amorphous flourish. A definition
of the radical form of the letter or sign by which it can be distinguished
from any other letter or sign is a very different proceeding. Therefore,
if a "mean" or resultant of any number of radically different signs to
express the same object or idea, observed either among several individuals
of the same tribe or among different tribes, is made to represent
those signs, they are all mutilated and ignored as distinctive
signs, though the result may possibly be made intelligible in practice,
according to principles mentioned in the present paper. The expedient
of a "mean" may be practically useful in the formation of a mere
interpreter's
jargon, but it elucidates no principle. It is also convenient
for any one determined to argue for the uniformity of sign language
as against the variety in unity apparent in all the realms of nature.
On the "mean" principle, he only needs to take his two-foot rule and
arithmetical tables and make all signs his signs and his signs all signs.
Of course they are uniform, because he has made them so after the
brutal example of Procrustes.</p>

<p>In this connection it is proper to urge a warning that a mere sign
talker is often a bad authority upon principles and theories. He may
not be liable to the satirical compliment of Dickens's "brave courier,"
who "understood all languages indifferently ill"; but many men speak
some one language fluently, and yet are wholly unable to explain or
analyze its words and forms so as to teach it to another person, or even
to give an intelligent summary or classification of their own knowledge.
What such a sign talker has learned is by memorizing, as a child may
learn English, and though both the sign talker and the child may be able
to give some separate items useful to a philologist or foreigner, such
items are spoiled when colored by the attempt of ignorance to theorize.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>[pg 332]</span>
A German who has studied English to thorough mastery, except in the
mere facility of speech, may in a discussion upon some of its principles
be contradicted by any mere English speaker, who insists upon his
superior knowledge because he actually speaks the language and his
antagonist does not, but the student will probably be correct and the
talker wrong. It is an old adage about oral speech that a man who
understands but one language understands none. The science of a
sign talker possessed by a restrictive theory is like that of Mirabeau,
who was greater as an orator than as a philologist, and who on a visit
to England gravely argued that there was something seriously wrong
in the British mind because the people would persist in saying "give
me some bread" instead of "<i>donnez-moi du pain</i>," which was so much
easier and more natural. A designedly ludicrous instance to the same
effect was Hood's arraignment of the French because they called their
mothers "mares" and their daughters "fillies." It is necessary to take
with caution any statement from a person who, having memorized or
hashed up any number of signs, large or small, has decided in his conceit
that those he uses are the only genuine Simon Pure, to be exclusively
employed according to his direction, all others being counterfeits
or blunders. His vocabulary has ceased to give the signs of any Indian
or body of Indians whatever, but becomes his own, the proprietorship
of which he fights for as if secured by letters-patent. When a
sign is contributed by one of the present collaborators, which such a
sign talker has not before seen or heard of, he will at once condemn it
as bad, just as a United States Minister to Vienna, who had been nursed
in the mongrel Dutch of Berks County, Pennsylvania, declared that the
people of Germany spoke very bad German.</p>

<p>An argument for the uniformity of the signs of our Indians is derived
from the fact that those used by any of them are generally understood by
others. But signs may be understood without being identical with any
before seen. The entribal as well as intertribal exercise of Indians for
generations in gesture language has naturally produced great skill both
in expression and reception, so as to render them measurably independent
of any prior mutual understanding, or what in a system of signals is called
preconcert. Two accomplished army signalists can, after sufficient trial,
communicate without having any code in common between them, one
being mutually devised, and those specially designed for secrecy are
often deciphered. So, if any one of the more conventional signs is
not quickly comprehended, an Indian skilled in the principle of signs
resorts to another expression of his flexible art, perhaps reproducing
the gesture unabbreviated and made more graphic, perhaps presenting
either the same or another conception or quality of the same object or
idea by an original portraiture.</p>

<p>An impression of the community of signs is the more readily made
because explorers and officials are naturally brought into contact more
closely with those individuals of the tribes visited who are experts in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>[pg 333]</span>
sign language than with their other members, and those experts, on
account of their skill as interpreters, are selected as guides to accompany
the visitors. The latter also seek occasion to be present when
signs are used, whether with or without words, in intertribal councils,
and then the same class of experts comprises the orators, for long exercise
in gesture speech has made the Indian politicians, with no special
effort, masters of the art acquired by our public speakers only after
laborious apprenticeship. The whole theory and practice of sign language
being that all who understand its principles can make themselves
mutually intelligible, the fact of the ready comprehension and response
among all the skilled gesturers gives the impression of a common code.
Furthermore, if the explorer learn to employ with ingenuity the signs used
by any of the tribes, he will probably be understood in any other by the
same class of persons who will surround him in the latter, thereby
confirming him in the "common" theory. Those of the tribe who are less
skilled, but who are not noticed, might be unable to catch the meaning
of signs which have not been actually taught to them, just as ignorant
persons among us cannot derive any sense from newly-coined words or
those strange to their habitual vocabulary, which, though never before
heard, linguistic scholars would instantly understand and might afterward
adopt.</p>

<p>It is also common experience that when Indians find that a sign which
has become conventional among their tribe is not understood by an
interlocutor,
a self-expressive sign is substituted for it, from which a visitor may
form the impression that there are no conventional signs. It may likewise
occur that the self-expressive sign substituted will be met with by
a visitor in several localities, different Indians, in their ingenuity,
taking the best and the same means of reaching the exotic intelligence.</p>

<p>There is some evidence that where sign language is now found among
Indian tribes it has become more uniform than ever before, simply because
many tribes have for some time past been forced to dwell near together
at peace. A collection was obtained in the spring of 1880, at Washington,
from a united delegation of the Kaiowa, Comanche, Apache, and
Wichita tribes, which was nearly uniform, but the individuals who gave
the signs had actually lived together at or near Anadarko, Indian
Territory,
for a considerable time, and the resulting uniformity of their signs
might either be considered as a jargon or as the natural tendency to
a compromise for mutual understanding&mdash;the unification so often observed
in oral speech, coming under many circumstances out of former
heterogeneity. The rule is that dialects precede languages and that out
of many dialects comes one language. It may be found that other individuals
of those same tribes who have from any cause not lived in the
union explained may have signs for the same ideas different from those
in the collection above mentioned. This is probable, because some signs
of other representatives of one of the component bodies&mdash;Apache&mdash;have
actually been reported differing from those for the same ideas given by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>[pg 334]</span>
the Anadarko group. The uniformity of the signs of those Arapahos,
Cheyennes, and Sioux who have been secluded for years at one particular
reservation, so far as could be done by governmental power, from the
outer world, was used in argument by a correspondent; but some collected
signs of other Cheyennes and Sioux differ, not only from those on
the reservation, but among each other. Therefore the signs used in
common by the tribes at the reservation seem to have been modified
and to a certain extent unified.</p>

<p>The result of the collation and analysis of the large number of signs
collected is that in numerous instances there is an entire discrepancy
between the signs made by different bodies of Indians to express the
same idea, and that if any of these are regarded as rigidly determinate,
or even conventional with a limited range, and used without further
devices, they will fail in conveying the desired impression to any one
unskilled in gesture as an art, who had not formed the same precise
conception or been instructed in the arbitrary motion. Few of the gestures
that are found in current use are, in their origin, conventional.
They are only portions, more or less elaborate, of obvious natural
pantomime, and those proving efficient to convey most successfully at any
time the several ideas became the most widely adopted, liable, however,
to be superseded by more appropriate conceptions and delineations. The
skill of any tribe and the copiousness of its signs are proportioned first
to the necessity for their use, and secondly to the accidental ability of
the individuals in it who act as custodians and teachers, so that the
several tribes at different times vary in their degree of proficiency, and
therefore both the precise mode of semiotic expression and the amount
of its general use are always fluctuating. Sign language as a product
of evolution has been developed rather than invented, and yet it seems
probable that each of the separate signs, like the several steps that lead
to any true invention, had a definite origin arising out of some
appropriate occasion, and the same sign may in this manner have had many
independent origins due to identity in the circumstances, or if lost, may
have been reproduced.</p>

<p>The process is precisely the same as that observed among deaf-mutes.
One of those unfortunate persons, living with his speaking relatives, may
invent signs which the latter are taught to understand, though strangers
sometimes will not, because they may be by no means the fittest
expressions. Should a dozen or more deaf-mutes, possessed only of such crude
signs, come together, they will be able at first to communicate only on
a few common subjects, but the number of those and the general scope
of expression will be continually enlarged. Each one commences with
his own conception and his own presentment of it, but the universality
of the medium used makes it sooner or later understood. This independent
development, thus creating diversity, often renders the first interchange
of thought between strangers slow, for the signs must be self-interpreting.
There can be no natural universal language which is absolute
and arbitrary. When used without convention, as sign language
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>[pg 335]</span>
alone of all modes of utterance can be, it must be tentative, experimental,
and flexible. The mutes will also resort to the invention of new signs
for new ideas as they arise, which will be made intelligible, if necessary,
through the illustration and definition given by signs formerly adopted,
so that the fittest signs will be evolved, after rivalry and trial, and
will survive. But there may not always be such a preponderance of fitness
that all but one of the rival signs shall die out, and some, being equal in
value to express the same idea or object, will continue to be used
indifferently,
or as a matter of individual taste, without confusion. A multiplication
of the numbers confined together, either of deaf-mutes or of Indians
whose speech is diverse, will not decrease the resulting uniformity,
though it will increase both the copiousness and the precision of the
vocabulary. The Indian use of signs, though maintained by linguistic
diversities, is not coincident with any linguistic boundaries. The tendency
is to their uniformity among groups of people who from any cause
are brought into contact with each other while still speaking different
languages. The longer and closer such contact, while no common tongue
is adopted, the greater will be the uniformity of signs.</p>

<p>Colonel Dodge takes a middle ground with regard to the identity of
the signs used by our Indians, comparing it with the dialects and
provincialisms
of the English language, as spoken in England, Ireland,
Scotland, and Wales. But those dialects are the remains of actually
diverse languages, which to some speakers have not become integrated.
In England alone the provincial dialects are traceable as the legacies of
Saxons, Angles, Jutes, and Danes, with a varying amount of Norman
influence. A thorough scholar in the composite tongue, now called English,
will be able to understand all the dialects and provincialisms of
English in the British Isles, but the uneducated man of Yorkshire is not
able to communicate readily with the equally uneducated man of
Somersetshire.
This is the true distinction to be made. A thorough sign talker
would be able to talk with several Indians who have no signs in common,
and who, if their knowledge of signs were only memorized, could not
communicate together. So also, as an educated Englishman will understand
the attempts of a foreigner to speak in very imperfect and broken English,
a good Indian sign expert will apprehend the feeble efforts of a tyro in
gestures. But Colonel Dodge's conclusion that there is but one true Indian
sign language, just as there is but one true English language, is not
proved unless it can be shown that a much larger proportion of the Indians
who use signs at all, than present researches show to be the case, use
identically the same signs to express the same ideas. It would also seem
necessary to the parallel that the signs so used should be absolute, if not
arbitrary, as are the words of an oral language, and not independent of
preconcert and self-interpreting at the instant of their invention or first
exhibition, as all true signs must originally have been and still
measurably
remain. All Indians, as all gesturing men, have many natural signs in
common and many others which are now conventional. The conventions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>[pg 336]</span>
by which the latter were established occurred during long periods, when
the tribes forming them were so separated as to have established altogether
diverse customs and mythologies, and when the several tribes were
with such different environment as to have formed varying conceptions
needing appropriate sign expression. The old error that the North
American Indians constitute one homogeneous race is now abandoned.
Nearly all the characteristics once alleged as segregating them from the
rest of mankind have proved not to belong to the whole of the
pre-Columbian population, but only to those portions of it first explored.
The practice of scalping is not now universal, even among the tribes least
influenced by civilization, if it ever was, and therefore the cultivation
of the scalp-lock separated from the rest of the hair of the head, or with
the removal of all other hair, is not a general feature of their
appearance. The arrangement of the hair is so different among tribes as to
be one of the most convenient modes for their pictorial distinction. The
war paint, red in some tribes, was black in others; the mystic rites of
the calumet were in many regions unknown, and the use of wampum
was by no means extensive. The wigwam is not the type of native
dwellings, which show as many differing forms as those of Europe. In
color there is great variety, and even admitting that the term "race"
is properly applied, no competent observer would characterize it as red,
still less copper-colored. Some tribes differ from each other in all
respects
nearly as much as either of them do from the lazzaroni of Naples,
and more than either do from certain tribes of Australia. It would
therefore be expected, as appears to be the case, that the conventional
signs of different stocks and regions differ as do the words of English,
French, and German, which, nevertheless, have sprung from the same
linguistic roots. No one of those languages is a dialect of any of the
others; and although the sign systems of the several tribes have greater
generic unity with less specific variety than oral languages, no one of
them is necessarily the dialect of any other.</p>

<p>Instead, therefore, of admitting, with present knowledge, that the
signs of our Indians are "identical" and "universal," it is the more
accurate
statement that the systematic attempt to convey meaning by
signs is universal among the Indians of the Plains, and those still
comparatively
unchanged by civilization. Its successful execution is by an
<i>art</i>, which, however it may have commenced as an instinctive mental
process, has been cultivated, and consists in actually pointing out objects
in sight not only for designation, but for application and predication, and
in suggesting others to the mind by action and the airy forms produced by
action. To insist that sign language is uniform were to assert that it is
perfect&mdash;"That faultless monster that the world ne'er saw."</p>


<h4>FORCED AND MISTAKEN SIGNS.</h4>

<p>Examination into the identity of signs is complicated by the fact that in
the collection and description of Indian signs there is danger lest the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>[pg 337]</span>
civilized understanding of them may be mistaken or forced. The liability
to those errors is much increased when the collections are not taken
directly from the Indians themselves, but are given as obtained at
second-hand
from white traders, trappers, and interpreters, who, through
misconception in the beginning and their own introduction or modification
of gestures, have produced a jargon in the sign, as well as in the
oral intercourse. An Indian talking in signs, either to a white man or
to another Indian using signs which he never saw before, catches the
meaning of that which is presented and adapts himself to it, at least
for the occasion. Even when he finds that his interlocutor insists upon
understanding and presenting a certain sign in a manner and with a
significance
widely different from those to which he has been accustomed,
it is within the very nature, tentative and elastic, of the gesture
art&mdash;both performers being on an equality&mdash;that he should adopt the
one that seems to be recognized or that is pressed upon him, as with
much greater difficulty he has learned and adopted many foreign terms
used with whites before attempting to acquire their language, but never
with his own race. Thus there is now, and perhaps always has been,
what may be called a <i>lingua-franca</i>, in the sign vocabulary. It is
well known that all the tribes of the Plains having learned by experience
that white visitors expect to receive certain signs really originating with
the latter, use them in their intercourse just as they sometimes do the
words "squaw" and "papoose," corruptions of the Algonkian, and once
as meaningless in the present West as the English terms "woman" and
"child," but which the first pioneers, having learned them on the Atlantic
coast, insisted upon treating as generally intelligible.</p>

<p>The perversity in attaching through preconceived views a wrong significance
to signs is illustrated by an anecdote found in several versions
and in several languages, but repeated as a veritable Scotch legend by
Duncan Anderson, esq., Principal of the Glasgow Institution for the Deaf
and Dumb, when he visited Washington in 1853.</p>

<p>King James I. of England, desiring to play a trick upon the Spanish
ambassador, a man of great erudition, but who had a crotchet in his
head upon sign language, informed him that there was a distinguished
professor of that science in the university at Aberdeen. The ambassador
set out for that place, preceded by a letter from the King with
instructions to make the best of him. There was in the town one Geordy,
a butcher, blind of one eye, a fellow of much wit and drollery. Geordy
is told to play the part of a professor, with the warning not to speak a
word; is gowned, wigged, and placed in a chair of state, when the
ambassador is shown in and they are left alone together. Presently the
nobleman came out greatly pleased with the experiment, claiming that
his theory was demonstrated. He said: "When I entered the room I
raised one finger to signify there is one God. He replied by raising two
fingers to signify that this Being rules over two worlds, the material
and the spiritual. Then I raised three fingers, to say there are three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>[pg 338]</span>
persons in the Godhead. He then closed his fingers, evidently to say
these three are one." After this explanation on the part of the nobleman
the professors sent for the butcher and asked him what took place
in the recitation room. He appeared very angry and said: "When the
crazy man entered the room where I was he raised one finger, as much
as to say I had but one eye, and I raised two fingers to signify that I
could see out of my one eye as well as he could out of both of his.
When he raised three fingers, as much as to say there were but three
eyes between us, I doubled up my fist, and if he had not gone out of
that room in a hurry I would have knocked him down."</p>

<p>The readiness with which a significance may be found in signs when
none whatever exists is also shown in the great contest narrated by
Rabelais between Panurge and the English philosopher, Thaumast, commencing
as follows:</p>

<p>"Everybody then taking heed in great silence, the Englishman lifted
his two hands separately, clinching the ends of his fingers in the form
that at Chion they call the fowl's tail. Then he struck them, together
by the nails four times. Then he opened them and struck one flat upon
the other with a clash once; after which, joining them as above, he
struck twice, and four times afterwards, on opening them. Then he
placed them, joined and extended the one above the other, seeming to
pray God devoutly.</p>

<p>"Panurge suddenly moved his right hand in the air, placed the
right-hand thumb at the right-hand nostril, holding the four fingers
stretched out and arrayed in parallel lines with the point of the nose;
shutting the left eye entirely, and winking with the right, making a
profound depression with eyebrow and eyelid. Next he raised aloft the left
with a strong clinching and extension of the four fingers and elevation of
the thumb, and held it in line directly corresponding with the position of
the right, the distance between the two being a cubit and a half. This
done, in the like manner he lowered towards the ground both hands, and
finally held them in the midst as if aiming straight at the Englishman's
nose."</p>

<p>And so on at great length. The whole performance of Panurge was
to save the credit of Pantagruel by making fantastic and mystic motions
in pretended disputation with the signs given by Thaumast in good
faith. Yet the latter confessed himself conquered, and declared that he
had derived inestimable information from the purposely meaningless
gestures. The satire upon the diverse interpretations of the gestures
of Naz-de-cabre (<i>Pantagruel</i>, Book III, chap. xx) is to the same
effect, showing it to have been a favorite theme with Rabelais.</p>


<h4>ABBREVIATIONS.</h4>

<p>A lesson was learned by the writer as to the abbreviation of signs,
and the possibility of discovering the original meaning of those most
obscure, from the attempts of a Cheyenne to convey the idea of <i>old man</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>[pg 339]</span>
He held his right hand forward, bent at elbow, fingers and thumb closed
sidewise. This not conveying any sense, he found a long stick, bent his
back, and supported his frame in a tottering step by the stick held, as
was before only imagined. Here at once was decrepit age dependent
on a staff. The principle of abbreviation or reduction may be illustrated
by supposing a person, under circumstances forbidding the use of the
voice, seeking to call attention to a particular bird on a tree, and
failing
to do so by mere indication. Descriptive signs are resorted to, perhaps
suggesting the bill and wings of the bird, its manner of clinging to the
twig with its feet, its size by seeming to hold it between the hands, its
color by pointing to objects of the same hue; perhaps by the action of
shooting into a tree, picking up the supposed fallen game, and plucking
feathers. These are continued until understood, and if one sign or
combination of signs proves to be successful it will be repeated on the
next occasion by both persons engaged, and after becoming familiar between
them and others will be more and more abbreviated. Conventionality
in signs largely consists in the form of abbreviation which is agreed upon.
When the signs of the Indians have from ideographic form thus become
demotic, they may be called conventional, but still not arbitrary. In
them, as in all his actions, man had at the first a definite meaning or
purpose, together with method in their subsequent changes or modifications.</p>

<p>Colonel Dodge gives a clear account of the manner in which an established
sign is abbreviated in practice, as follows: "There are an almost
infinite number and variety of abbreviations. For instance, to tell a
man to 'talk,' the most common formal sign is made thus: Hold the
right hand in front of, the back near, the mouth, end of thumb and
index-finger joined into an 'O,' the outer fingers closed on the palm;
throw the hand forward sharply by a quick motion of the wrist, and
at the same time flip forward the index-finger. This may be done once
or several times.</p>

<p>"The formal sign to 'cease' or 'stop doing' anything is made by bringing
the two hands open and held vertically in front of the body, one
behind the other, then quickly pass one upward, the other downward,
simulating somewhat the motion of the limbs of a pair of scissors,
meaning 'cut it off.' The latter sign is made in conversation in a variety
of ways, but habitually with one hand only.</p>

<p>"The formal sign to 'stop talking' is first to make the formal sign for
'talk,' then the formal sign for 'cut;' but this is commonly abbreviated
by first making the formal sign for 'talk' with the right hand, and then
immediately passing the same hand, open, fingers extended, downward
across and in front of the mouth, 'talk, cut.'</p>

<p>"But though the Plains Indian, if asked for the sign to 'stop talking,'
will properly give the sign either in its extended or abbreviated
form as above, he in conversation abbreviates it so much further that
the sign loses almost all resemblance to its former self. Whatever the
position of the hand, a turn of the wrist, a flip of the forefinger, and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>[pg 340]</span>
turn, of the wrist back to its original position is fully equivalent to the
elaborate signs."</p>

<p>It may be added that nearly every sign which to be intelligibly described
and as exhibited in full requires the use of both hands, is outlined,
with one hand only, by skillful Indians gesturing between themselves,
so as to be clearly understood between them. Two Indians, whose
blankets are closely held to their bodies by the left hand, which is
necessarily
rendered unavailable for gesture, will severally thrust the right
from beneath the protecting folds and converse freely. The same is true
when one hand of each holds the bridle of a horse.</p>

<p>The Italian signs are also made in such abbreviated forms as to be
little more than hinted at, requiring a perfect knowledge of the full and
original form before the slight and often furtive suggestion of it can be
understood. Deaf-mutes continually seek by tacit agreement to shorten
their signs more and more. While the original of each may be preserved
in root or stem, it is only known to the proficient, as the root
or stem of a plant enables botanists, but no others, to distinguish it.
Thus the natural character of signs, the universal significance which is
their peculiarly distinctive feature, may and often does become lost.
From the operation of the principle of independent and individual
abbreviation
inherent in all sign language, without any other cause, that of
the Indians must in one or two generations have become diverse, even
if it had in fact originated from one tribe in which all conceptions and
executions were absolute.</p>



<h3><i>ARE SIGNS CONVENTIONAL OR INSTINCTIVE?</i></h3>

<p>There has been much discussion on the question whether gesture signs
were originally invented, in the strict sense of that term, or whether they
result from a natural connection between them and the ideas represented
by them, that is whether they are conventional or instinctive.
Cardinal Wiseman (<i>Essays</i>, III, 537) thinks that they are of both
characters;
but referring particularly to the Italian signs and the proper
mode of discovering their meaning, observes that they are used primarily
with words and from the usual accompaniment of certain phrases.
"For these the gestures become substitutes, and then by association
express all their meaning, even when used alone." This would be the
process only where systematic gestures had never prevailed or had been
so disused as to be forgotten, and were adopted after elaborate oral
phrases and traditional oral expressions had become common. In other
parts of this paper it is suggested that conventionality chiefly consists
in abbreviation, and that signs are originally self-interpreting,
independent
of words, and therefore in a certain sense instinctive.</p>

<p>Another form of the above query, having the same intent, is whether
signs are arbitrary or natural. The answer will depend upon what the
observer considers to be natural to himself. A common sign among
both deaf-mutes and Indians for <i>woman</i> consists in designating the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>[pg 341]</span>
arrangement of the hair, but such a represented arrangement of hair
familiar to the gesturer as had never been seen by the person addressed
would not seem "natural" to the latter. It would be classed as arbitrary,
and could not be understood without context or explanation,
indeed without translation such as is required from foreign oral speech.
Signs most naturally, that is, appropriately, expressing a conception of
the thing signified, are first adopted and afterwards modified by
circumstances
of environment, so as to appear, without full understanding,
conventional and arbitrary, yet they are as truly "natural" as the signs
for
hearing, seeing, eating, and drinking, which continue all over the world
as they were first formed because there is no change in those operations.</p>



<h3><i>CLASSES OF DIVERSITIES IN SIGNS.</i></h3>

<p>While there is not sufficient evidence that any exhibition of sign
language in any tribe is a dialect derived or corrupted from an ascertained
language in any other tribe, it still is convenient to consider the
different forms appearing in different tribes as several dialects (in the
usual mode of using that term) of a common language. Every sign
talker necessarily has, to some extent, a dialect of his own. No one
can use sign language without original invention and without modification
of the inventions of others; and all such new inventions and modifications
have a tendency to spread and influence the production of other
variations. The diversities thus occasioned are more distinct than that
mere individuality of style or expression which may be likened to the
differing chirography of men who write, although such individual
characteristics
also constitute an important element of confusion to the
inexperienced observer. In differing handwriting there is always an
attempt or desire to represent an alphabet which is essentially
determinate,
but no such fixedness or limited condition of form restricts
gesture speech.</p>

<p>Those variations and diversities of form and connected significance
specially calling for notice may be: 1st. In the nature of synonyms.
2d. Substantially the same form with such different signification as not
to be synonymous. 3d. Difference in significance produced by such
slight variation in form as to be, to a careless observer, <i>symmorphic</i>.</p>


<h4>SYNONYMS.</h4>

<p>In this division are placed signs of differing forms which are used in
senses so nearly the same as to have only a slight shade of distinction,
or sometimes to be practically interchangeable. The comprehensive
and metaphorical character of signs renders more of them interchangeable
than is the case with words; still, like words, some signs with
essential resemblance of meaning have partial and subordinate differences
made by etymology or usage. Doubtless signs are purposely
selected as delineating the most striking outlines of an object, or the
most characteristic features of an action; but different individuals, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>[pg 342]</span>
likewise different bodies of people, would not always agree in the
selection of those outlines and features. Taking the illustration of the
attempt to invent a sign for <i>bird</i>, before used, any one of a dozen,
signs might have been agreed upon with equal appropriateness, and, in
fact, a number have been so selected by several individuals and tribes,
each one, therefore, being a synonym of the other. Another example of
this is in the signs for <i>deer</i>, designated by various modes of
expressing
fleetness, by his gait when not in rapid motion, by the shape of his horns,
by the color of his tail, and sometimes by combinations of several of
those characteristics. Each of these signs may be indefinitely abbreviated,
and therefore create indefinite diversity. Another illustration, in
which an association of ideas is apparent, is in the upward raising of
the index in front of and above the head, which means <i>above</i>
(sometimes containing the religious conception of <i>heaven, great
spirit</i>, &amp;c.), and also <i>now, to-day</i>. Not unfrequently these
several signs to express the
same ideas are used interchangeably by the same people, and some one
of the duplicates or triplicates may have been noticed by separate
observers to the exclusion of the others. On the other hand, they might
all have been noticed, but each one among different bodies. Thus confusing
reports would be received, which might either be erroneous in
deducing the prevalence of particular signs or the opposite. Sometimes
the synonym may be recognized as an imported sign, used with another
tribe known to affect it. Sometimes the diverse signs to express the
same thing are only different trials at reaching the intelligence of the
person addressed. An account is given by Lieut. Heber M. Creel, Seventh
Cavalry, U.S.A., of an old Cheyenne squaw, who made about
twenty successive and original signs to a recruit of the Fourth Cavalry
to let him know that she wanted to obtain out of a wagon a piece of
cloth belonging to her, to wipe out an oven preparatory to baking bread.
Thus by tradition, importation, recent invention, or from all these causes
together, several signs entirely distinct are produced for the same object
or action.</p>

<p>This class is not intended to embrace the cases common both to sign and
oral language where the same sign has several meanings, according to the
expression, whether facial or vocal, and the general manner accompanying
its delivery. The sign given, for "stop talking" on page <a href="#page339">339</a> may be
used in simple acquiescence, "very well," "all right!" or for
comprehension,
"I understand;" or in impatience, "you have talked enough!" which
may be carried further to express actual anger in the violent "shut up!"
But all these grades of thought accompany the idea of a cessation of
talk. In like manner an acquaintance of the writer asking the same
favor (a permission to go through their camp) of two chiefs, was answered
by both with the sign generally used for repletion after eating, viz., the
index and thumb turned toward the body, passed up from the abdomen
to the throat; but in the one case, being made with a gentle motion and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>[pg 343]</span>
pleasant look, it meant, "I am satisfied," and granted the request; in the
other, made violently, with the accompaniment of a truculent frown, it
read, "I have had enough of that!" But these two meanings might also have
been expressed by different intonations of the English word "enough." The
class of signs now in view is better exemplified by the French word
<i>souris</i>, which is spelled and pronounced precisely the same with the
two wholly distinct and independent significations of <i>smile</i> and
<i>mouse</i>. From many examples may be selected the Omaha sign for
<i>think,
guess</i>, which is precisely the same as that of the Absaroka, Shoshoni
and Banak for <i>brave</i>, see page <a href="#page414">414</a>. The context alone, both of the
sign and the word, determines in what one of its senses it is at the time
used, but it is not discriminated merely by a difference in expression.</p>

<p>It would have been very remarkable if precisely the same sign were not
used by different or even the same persons or bodies of people with wholly
distinct significations. The graphic forms for objects and ideas are much
more likely to be coincident than sound is for similar expressions, yet in
all
oral languages the same precise sound is used for utterly diverse meanings.
The first conception of many different objects must have been the
same. It has been found; indeed, that the homophony of words and the
homomorphy of ideographic pictures is noticeable in opposite
significations,
the conceptions arising from the opposition itself. The differentiation
in portraiture or accent is a subsequent and remedial step not
taken until after the confusion has been observed and become inconvenient.
Such confusion and contradiction would only be eliminated if
sign language were absolutely perfect as well as absolutely universal.</p>


<h4>SYMMORPHS.</h4>

<p>In this class are included those signs conveying different ideas, and
really different in form of execution as well as in conception, yet in
which the difference in form is so slight as practically
to require attention and discrimination. An example
from oral speech may be found in the English word
"desert," which, as pronounced "des'-ert" or "desert',"
and in a slightly changed form, "dessert," has such
widely varying significations. These distinctions relating
to signs require graphic illustration.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:20%;"><a href="images/fig112.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig112.png" alt="Tree. Dakota, Hidatsu" /></a>Fig. 112.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width:20%;"><a href="images/fig113.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig113.png" alt="To grow. N.A. Indian" /></a>Fig. 113.</div>

<p>The sign made by the Dakota, Hidatsa,
and several other tribes, for <i>tree</i> is made
by holding the right hand before the body,
back forward, fingers and thumb separated,
then pushing it slightly upward,
Fig. 112. That for <i>grass</i> is the same made
near the ground; that for <i>grow</i> is made
like <i>grass</i>, though instead of holding the back of the hand near the
ground the hand is pushed upward in an interrupted manner, Fig. 113. For
<i>smoke</i>, the hand (with the back down, fingers pointing upward as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>[pg 344]</span>
in <i>grow</i>) is thrown upward several times from the same place instead
of continuing the whole motion upward. Frequently the fingers are
thrown forward from under the thumb with each successive upward
motion. For <i>fire</i>, the hand is employed as in the gesture for
<i>smoke</i>, but
the motion is frequently more waving, and in other cases made higher
from the ground.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/fig114.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig114.png" alt="Rain. Shoshoni, Apache" /></a>Fig. 114.</div>

<p>The sign for <i>rain</i>, made by the Shoshoni, Apache, and other Indians,
is by holding the hand (or hands) at
the height of and before the shoulder,
fingers pendent, palm down, then
pushing it downward a short distance,
Fig. 114. That for <i>heat</i> is the
same, with the difference that the
hand is held above the head and
thrust downward toward the forehead;
that for <i>to weep</i> is made by
holding the hand as in <i>rain</i>, and the
gesture made from the eye downward
over the cheek, back of the
fingers nearly touching the face.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:15%;"><a href="images/fig115.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig115.png" alt="Sun. N.A. Indian" /></a>Fig. 115.</div>

<p>The common sign for <i>sun</i> is made
by bringing the tips of the thumb and index together so as to form a
circle; remaining fingers closed. The hand is then held toward the sky,
Fig. 115. The motion with the same circular position of index and
thumb is for <i>want</i>, by bringing the hand backward toward the mouth,
in a curve forming a short arch between the origin and termination
of the gesture.</p>

<p>For <i>drink</i> the gesture by several tribes is the same as for
<i>want</i>, with the slight difference in the position of the last
three fingers, which are not so tightly clinched, forming
somewhat the shape of a cup; and that for <i>money</i> is made by
holding out the hand with the same arrangement of fingers
in front of the hips, at a distance of about twelve or fifteen inches.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/fig116.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig116.png" alt="Sun. Cheyenne" /></a>Fig. 116.</div>

<p>Another sign for <i>sun</i>, made by the Cheyennes, is by placing the tips
of the partly separated thumb and index of one hand against those of
the other, approximating a circle, and
holding them toward the sky, Fig. 116,
and that for <i>various things</i>, observed
among the Brul&#233; Sioux with the same
position of the hands, is made by placing
the circle horizontal, and moving it interruptedly
toward the right side, each
movement forming a short arch. Compare also the sign for <i>village</i>,
described
on page <a href="#page386">386</a>.</p>

<p>The Arikara sign for <i>soldier</i> is by placing the clinched hands
together
before the breast, thumbs touching, then drawing them horizontally outward
toward their respective sides, Fig. 117. That for <i>done</i>, made by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>[pg 345]</span>
the Hidatsa, is shown below in this paper, see Fig. 334, page <a href="#page528">528</a>. That
for <i>much</i> (<i>Cheyenne</i> I, <i>Comanche</i> III), see Fig. 274, page <a href="#page447">447</a>,
is to be correlated
with the above.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:80%;"><a href="images/fig117.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig117.png" alt="Soldier. Arikara" /></a>Fig. 117.</div>

<p>The sign for <i>to be told</i> or <i>talked to</i>, and for the reception
of speech, by the tribes generally, is made by placing the
flat right hand, palm upward,
about fifteen inches in front of the right side of the face or breast,
fingers pointing to the left, then drawing the hand toward the bottom
of the chin, and is illustrated in Fig. 71, page <a href="#page291">291</a>. The Comanche sign
for <i>give</i> or <i>asking</i> is shown in Fig. 301, page <a href="#page480">480</a>
(<i>Comanche</i> III), and is
made by bringing the hand toward the body but a short distance, and the
motion repeated, the tips of the fingers indicating the outline of a circle.</p>

<p>The tribal sign for <i>Kaiowa</i>, illustrated in its place among the
<span class="sc">Tribal Signs</span>, is made by holding the hand with extended and separated fingers
and thumb near the side of the head, back outward, and giving it a
rotary motion. This gesture is made in front of the face by many tribes.
The generic sign for <i>deer</i>, made by the Dakota and some others, is by
holding
the hand motionless at the side of the head, with extended and separated
thumb and fingers, representing the branched antlers. That for
<i>fool</i>, reported from the same Indians, is the same as above described
for <i>Kaiowa</i>, which it also signifies, though frequently only one or
two fingers are used.</p>

<p>The tribal sign both for the <i>Sahaptin</i> or <i>Nez Perc&#233;s</i> and for
<i>Caddo</i> (see
<span class="sc">Tribal Signs</span>) is made by passing the extended index, pointing under
the nose from right to left. When the second finger is not tightly closed
it strongly resembles the sign often made for <i>lie, falsehood</i>, by
passing
the extended index and second fingers separated toward the left, over
the mouth.</p>

<p>The tribal sign for Cheyenne (see <span class="sc">Tribal Signs</span>) differs from the sign
for <i>spotted</i> only in the finger (or hand) in the latter being
alternately passed across the upper and lower sides of the left forearm.</p>

<p>The sign for <i>steal, theft</i>, see Fig. 75, page <a href="#page293">293</a>, is but slightly
different
from that for <i>bear</i>, see Fig. 239, page <a href="#page413">413</a>, especially when the
latter is
made with one hand only. The distinction, however, is that the grasping
in the latter sign is not followed by the idea of concealment in the
former, which is executed by the right hand, after the motion of grasping,
being brought toward and sometimes under the left armpit.</p>

<p><i>Cold</i> and <i>winter</i>, see Tendoy-Huerito Dialogue, page <a href="#page486">486</a>, may
be compared
with <i>love</i>, see Kin Ch&#275;-&#277;ss' speech, page <a href="#page521">521</a>, and with
<i>prisoner</i>. In
these the difference consists in that <i>cold</i> and <i>winter</i> are
represented by
crossing the arms with clinched hands before the breast; <i>love</i> by
crossing
the arms so as to bring the fists more under the chin, and <i>prisoner</i>
by holding the crossed wrists a foot in front of the breast.</p>

<p><i>Melon, squash, muskmelon</i>, used by the Utes and Apaches, is made by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>[pg 346]</span>
holding the hand arched, fingers separated and pointing forward, and
pushing the hand forward over a slight curve near the ground, and the
generic sign for <i>animals</i> by the Apaches is made in the same manner
at the height intended to represent the object.</p>

<p>The sign for <i>where?</i>, and <i>to search</i>, <i>to seek for</i>, made
by the Dakota (IV),
is by holding the back of the hand upward, index pointing forward,
and carrying it from left to right about eight inches, raising and lowering
it several times while so doing, as if quickly pointing at different
objects. That for <i>some of them</i>, a part of a number of things or
persons, made by the Kaiowa, Comanche, Wichita, and Apache Indians is nearly
identical, the gesture being made less rapidly.</p>




<h2>RESULTS SOUGHT IN THE STUDY OF SIGN LANGUAGE.</h2>


<p>These may be divided into (1) its practical application, (2) its aid to
philologic researches in general with (3) particular reference to the
grammatic machinery of language, and (4) its arch&#230;ologic relations.</p>



<h3><i>PRACTICAL APPLICATION.</i></h3>

<p>The most obvious application of Indian sign language will for its
practical utility depend, to a large extent, upon the correctness of the
view submitted by the present writer that it is not a mere semaphoric
repetition of motions to be memorized from a limited traditional list,
but is a cultivated art, founded upon principles which can be readily
applied by travelers and officials, so as to give them much independence
of professional interpreters&mdash;as a class dangerously deceitful and tricky.
This advantage is not merely theoretical, but has been demonstrated to
be practical by a professor in a deaf mute college who, lately visiting
several of the wild tribes of the plains, made himself understood among
all of them without knowing a word of any of their languages; nor
would it only be experienced in connection with American tribes, being
applicable to intercourse with savages in Africa and Asia, though it is
not pretended to fulfill by this agency the schoolmen's dream of an
ecumenical mode of communication between all peoples in spite of their
dialectic divisions.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the practical value of signs for intercourse
with the American Indians will not long continue, their general progress
in the acquisition of English or of Spanish being so rapid that those
languages are becoming, to a surprising extent, the common medium,
and signs are proportionally disused. Nor is a systematic use of signs
of so great assistance in communicating with foreigners, whose speech is
not understood, as might at first be supposed, unless indeed both parties
agree to cease all attempt at oral language, relying wholly upon
gestures. So long as words are used at all, signs will be made only as
their accompaniment, and they will not always be ideographic.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>[pg 347]</span>
An amusing instance in which savages showed their preference to
signs instead of even an onomatope may be quoted from Wilfred Powell's
<i>Observations on New Britain and neighboring Islands during Six
Years' Exploration</i>, in <i>Proc. Roy. Geog. Soc</i>., vol. iii, No. 2
(new
monthly series), February, 1881, p. 89, 90: "On one occasion, wishing
to purchase a pig, and not knowing very well how to set about it, being
ignorant of the dialect, which is totally different from that of the
natives
in the north, I asked Mr. Brown how I should manage, or what he
thought would be the best way of making them understand. He said,
'Why don't you try granting?' whereupon I began to grunt most vociferously.
The effect was magical. Some of them jumped back, holding
their spears in readiness to throw; others ran away, covering their eyes
with their hands, and all exhibited the utmost astonishment and alarm.
In fact, it was so evident that they expected me to turn into a pig, and
their alarm was so irresistibly comic, that Mr. Brown and I both burst
out laughing, on which they gradually became more reassured, and
those that had run away came back, and seeing us so heartily amused,
and that I had not undergone any metamorphosis, began to laugh too;
but when I drew a pig on the sand with a piece of stick, and made motions
of eating, it suddenly seemed to strike them what was the matter,
for they all burst out laughing, nodding their heads, and several of
them ran off, evidently in quest of the pig that was required."</p>


<h4>POWERS OF SIGNS COMPARED WITH SPEECH.</h4>

<p>Sign language, being the mother utterance of nature, poetically styled
by Lamartine the visible attitudes of the soul, is superior to all others
in that it permits every one to find in nature an image to express his
thoughts on the most needful matters intelligently to any other person.
The direct or substantial natural analogy peculiar to it prevents a
confusion
of ideas. It is to some extent possible to use words without understanding
them which yet may be understood by those addressed,
but it is hardly possible to use signs without full comprehension of them.
Separate words may also be comprehended by persons hearing them
without the whole connected sense of the words taken together being
caught, but signs are more intimately connected. Even those most
appropriate will not be understood if the subject is beyond the
comprehension
of their beholders. They would be as unintelligible as the wild
clicks of his instrument, in an electric storm, would be to the
telegrapher,
or as the semaphore, driven by wind, to the signalist. In oral speech
even onomatopes are arbitrary, the most strictly natural sounds striking
the ear of different individuals and nations in a manner wholly diverse.
The instances given by <span class="sc">Sayce</span> are in point. Exactly the same sound
was intended to be reproduced in the "<i>bilbit</i> amphora" of N&#230;vius,
the
"<i>glut glut</i> murmurat unda sonans" of the Latin Anthology, and the
"<i>puls</i>"
of Varro. The Persian "<i>bulbul</i>," the "<i>jugjug</i>" of Gascoigne,
and the
"<i>whitwhit</i>" of others are all attempts at imitating the note of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>[pg 348]</span>
nightingale. Successful signs must have a much closer analogy and establish,
a <i>consensus</i> between the talkers far beyond that produced by the mere
sound of words.</p>

<p>Gestures, in the degree of their pantomimic character, excel in graphic
and dramatic effect applied to narrative and to rhetorical exhibition, and
beyond any other mode of description give the force of reality. Speech,
when highly cultivated, is better adapted to generalization and
abstraction;
therefore to logic and metaphysics. The latter must ever henceforth,
be the superior in formulating thoughts. Some of the enthusiasts
in signs have contended that this unfavorable distinction is not from
any inherent incapability, but because their employment has not been
continued unto perfection, and that if they had been elaborated by the
secular labor devoted to spoken language they might in resources and
distinctiveness have exceeded many forms of the latter. Gallaudet, Peet,
and others maybe right in asserting that man could by his arms, hands,
and fingers, with facial and bodily accentuation, express any idea that
could be conveyed by words.</p>

<p>The combinations which can be made with corporeal signs are infinite.
It has been before argued that a high degree of culture might have
been attained by man without articulate speech and it is but a further step
in the reasoning to conclude that if articulate speech had not been
possessed
or acquired, necessity would have developed gesture language
to a degree far beyond any known exhibition of it. The continually
advancing civilization and continually increasing intercourse of countless
ages has perfected oral speech, and as both, civilization and intercourse
were possible with signs alone it is to be supposed that they
would have advanced in some corresponding manner. But as sign language
has been chiefly used during historic time either as a scaffolding
around a more valuable structure to be thrown aside when the latter was
completed, or as an occasional substitute, such development was not to
be expected.</p>

<p>The process of forming signs to express abstract ideas is only a variant
from that of oral speech, in which the words for the most abstract ideas,
such as law, virtue, infinitude, and immortality, are shown by Max M&#252;ller
to have been derived and deduced, that is, abstracted, from sensuous
impressions. In the use of signs the countenance and manner as well as
the tenor decide whether objects themselves are intended, or the forms,
positions, qualities, and motions of other objects which are suggested,
and signs for moral and intellectual ideas, founded on analogies, are
common all over the world as well as among deaf-mutes. Concepts of
the intangible and invisible are only learned through percepts of tangible
and visible objects, whether finally expressed to the eye or to the
ear, in terms of sight or of sound.</p>

<p>Sign language is so faithful to nature, and so essentially living in its
expression, that it is not probable that it will ever die. It may become
disused, but will revert. Its elements are ever natural and universal, by
recurring to which the less natural signs adopted dialectically or for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>[pg 349]</span>
expedition can always, with, some circumlocution, be explained. This
power of interpreting itself is a peculiar advantage, for spoken languages,
unless explained by gestures or indications, can only be interpreted by
means of some other spoken language. When highly cultivated, its
rapidity on familiar subjects exceeds that of speech and approaches to
that of thought itself. This statement may be startling to those who
only notice that a selected spoken word may convey in an instant a
meaning for which the motions of even an expert in signs may require
a much longer time, but it must be considered that oral speech is now
wholly conventional, and that with the similar development of sign language
conventional expressions with hands and body could be made
more quickly than with the vocal organs, because more organs could be
worked at once. Without such supposed development the habitual
communication between deaf-mutes and among Indians using signs is
perhaps as rapid as between the ignorant class of speakers upon the
same subjects, and in many instances the signs would win at a trial of
speed. At the same time it must be admitted that great increase in
rapidity is chiefly obtained by the system of preconcerted abbreviations,
before explained, and by the adoption of arbitrary forms, in which
naturalness
is sacrificed and conventionality established, as has been the
case with all spoken languages in the degree in which they have become
copious and convenient.</p>

<p>There is another characteristic of the gesture speech that, though it
cannot be resorted to in the dark, nor where the attention of the person
addressed has not been otherwise attracted, it has the countervailing
benefit of use when the voice could not be employed. This may be an
advantage
at a distance which the eye can reach, but not the ear, and still
more frequently when silence or secrecy is desired. Dalgarno recommends
it for use in the presence of great people, who ought not to
be disturbed, and curiously enough "Disappearing Mist," the Iroquois
chief, speaks of the former extensive use of signs in his tribe by women
and boys as a mark of respect to warriors and elders, their voices, in
the good old days, not being uplifted in the presence of the latter. The
decay of that wholesome state of discipline, he thinks, accounts partly
for the disappearance of the use of signs among the modern impudent
youth and the dusky claimants of woman's rights.</p>

<p>An instance of the additional power gained to a speaker of ordinary
language by the use of signs, impressed the writer while dictating to
two amanuenses at the same moment, to the one by signs and the other
by words, on different subjects, a practice which would have enabled
C&#230;sar to surpass his celebrated feat. It would also be easy to talk to
a deaf and blind man at once, the latter being addressed by the voice
and the former in signs.</p>



<h3><i>RELATIONS TO PHILOLOGY.</i></h3>

<p>The aid to be derived from the study of sign language in prosecuting
researches into the science of language was pointed out by <span class="sc">Leibnitz</span>, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>[pg 350]</span>
his <i>Collectanea Etymologica</i>, without hitherto exciting any thorough
or
scientific work in that direction, the obstacle to it probably being that
scholars competent in other respects had no adequate data of the gesture
speech of man to be used in comparison. The latter will, it is hoped, be
supplied by the work now undertaken.</p>

<p>In the first part of this paper it was suggested that signs played an
important part in giving meaning to spoken words. Philology, comparing
the languages of earth in their radicals, must therefore include
the graphic or manual presentation of thought, and compare the elements
of ideography with those of phonics. Etymology now examines
the ultimate roots, not the fanciful resemblances between oral forms,
in the different tongues; the internal, not the mere external parts of
language. A marked peculiarity of sign language consists in its limited
number of radicals and the infinite combinations into which those
radicals enter while still remaining distinctive. It is therefore a proper
field for etymologic study.</p>

<p>From these and other considerations it is supposed that an analysis
of the original conceptions of gestures, studied together with the
holophrastic
roots in the speech of the gesturers, may aid in the ascertainment
of some relation between concrete ideas and words. Meaning does not
adhere to the phonic presentation of thought, while it does to signs. The
latter are doubtless more flexible and in that sense more mutable than
words, but the ideas attached to them are persistent, and therefore there
is not much greater metamorphosis in the signs than in the cognitions.
The further a language has been developed from its primordial roots,
which have been twisted into forms no longer suggesting any reason for
their original selection, and the more the primitive significance of its
words has disappeared, the fewer points of contact can it retain with
signs. The higher languages are more precise because the consciousness
of the derivation of most of their words is lost, so that they have
become counters, good for any sense agreed upon and for no other.</p>

<p>It is, however, possible to ascertain the included gesture even in many
English words. The class represented by the word <i>supercilious</i> will
occur
to all readers, but one or two examples may be given not so obvious and
more immediately connected with the gestures of our Indians.
<i>Imbecile</i>,
generally applied to the weakness of old age, is derived from the Latin
<i>in</i>, in the sense of on, and <i>bacillum</i>, a staff, which at once
recalls the Cheyenne
sign for <i>old man</i>, mentioned above, page <a href="#page339">339</a>. So <i>time</i> appears
more nearly connected with &tau;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;&omega;, to stretch, when
information is given
of the sign for <i>long time</i>, in the Speech of Kin
Ch&#275;-&#277;ss, in this paper, viz.,
placing the thumbs and forefingers in such a position as if a small thread
was held between the thumb and forefinger of each hand, the hands first
touching each other, and then moving slowly from each other, as if
<i>stretching</i> a piece of gum-elastic.</p>

<p>In the languages of North America, which have not become arbitrary
to the degree exhibited by those of civilized man, the connection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>[pg 351]</span>
between the idea and the word is only less obvious than, that still unbroken
between the idea and the sign, and they remain strongly affected by the
concepts of outline, form, place, position, and feature on which gesture
is founded, while they are similar in their fertile combination of
radicals.</p>

<p>Indian language consists of a series of words that are but slightly
differentiated parts of speech following each other in the order suggested
in the mind of the speaker without absolute laws of arrangement,
as its sentences are not completely integrated. The sentence
necessitates parts of speech, and parts of speech are possible only when
a language has reached that stage where sentences are logically
constructed.
The words of an Indian tongue, being synthetic or undifferentiated
parts of speech, are in this respect strictly analogous to the
gesture elements which enter into a sign language. The study of the
latter is therefore valuable for comparison with the words of the former.
The one language throws much light upon the other, and neither can be
studied to the best advantage without a knowledge of the other.</p>

<p>Some special resemblances between the language of signs and the character
of the oral languages found on this continent may be mentioned.
Dr. <span class="sc">J. Hammond Trumbull</span> remarks of the composition of their
words that they were "so constructed as to be thoroughly self-defining
and immediately intelligible to the hearer." In another connection the
remark is further enforced: "Indeed, it is a requirement of the Indian
languages that every word shall be so framed as to admit of immediate
resolution to its significant elements by the hearer. It must be thoroughly
<i>self-defining</i>, for (as Max M&#252;ller has expressed it) 'it requires
tradition, society, and literature to maintain words which can no longer be
analyzed at once.'... In the ever-shifting state of a nomadic
society no debased coin can be tolerated in language, no obscure legend
accepted on trust. The metal must be pure and the legend distinct."</p>

<p>Indian languages, like those of higher development, sometimes exhibit
changes of form by the permutation of vowels, but often an incorporated
particle, whether suffix, affix, or infix, shows the etymology which often,
also, exhibits the same objective conception that would be executed in
gesture. There are, for instance, different forms for standing, sitting,
lying, falling, &amp;c., and for standing, sitting, lying on or falling from
the same level or a higher or lower level. This resembles the pictorial
conception and execution of signs.</p>

<p>Major <span class="sc">J.W. Powell</span>, with particular reference to the disadvantages of
the multiplied inflections in Indian languages, alike with the Greek and
Latin, when the speaker is compelled, in the choice of a word to express
his idea, to think of a great multiplicity of things, gives the following
instance:</p>

<p>"A Ponca Indian in saying that a man killed a rabbit, would have to
say: the man, he, one, animate, standing, in the nominative case, purposely
killed, by shooting an arrow, the rabbit, he, the one, animate,
sitting, in the objective case; for the form of a verb to kill would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>[pg 352]</span>
to be selected, and the verb changes its form by inflection and
incorporated particles to denote person, number, and gender as animate or
inanimate, and gender as standing, sitting, or lying, and case; and the
form of the verb would also express whether the killing was done
accidentally or purposely, and whether it was by shooting or by some other
process, and, if by shooting, whether by bow and arrow, or with a gun;
and the form of the verb would in like manner have to express all of
these things relating to the object; that is, the person, number, gender,
and case of the object; and from the multiplicity of paradigmatic forms
of the verb to kill, this particular one would have to be selected." This
is substantially the mode in which an Indian sign talker would find it
necessary to tell the story, as is shown by several examples given below
in narratives, speeches, and dialogues.</p>

<p>Indian languages exhibit the same fondness for demonstration which
is necessary in sign language. The two forms of utterance are alike in
their want of power to express certain words, such as the verb "to be,"
and in the criterion of organization, so far as concerns a high degree of
synthesis and imperfect differentiation, they bear substantially the same
relation to the English language.</p>

<p>It may finally be added that as not only proper names but nouns, generally
in Indian languages are connotive, predicating some attribute of
the object, they can readily be expressed by gesture signs, and therefore
among them, if anywhere, it is to be expected that relations may be
established between the words and the signs.</p>


<h4>ETYMOLOGY OF WORDS FROM GESTURES.</h4>

<p>There can be no attempt in the present limits to trace the etymology
of any large number of words in the several Indian languages to a gestural
origin, nor, if the space allowed, would it be satisfactory. The
signs have scarcely yet been collected, verified, and collated in
sufficient
numbers for such comparison, even with the few of the Indian languages
the radicals of which have been scientifically studied. The signs will,
in a future work, be frequently presented in connection with the
corresponding
words of the gesturers, as is done now in a few instances in
another part of this paper. For the present the subject is only indicated
by the following examples, introduced to suggest the character of the
study in which the students of American linguistics are urgently requested
to assist:</p>

<p>The Dakota word <i>Sha<sup>n</sup>te-suta</i>&mdash;from <i>sha<sup>n</sup>te</i>, heart, and
<i>suta</i>, strong&mdash;<i>brave</i>,
not cowardly, literally strong-hearted, is made by several tribes of
that stock, and particularly by the Brul&#233; Sioux, in gestures by collecting
the tips of the fingers and thumb of the right hand to a point, and
then placing the radial side of the hand over the heart, finger tips
pointing
downward&mdash;<i>heart</i>; then place the left fist, palm inward, horizontally
before the lower portion of the breast, the right fist back of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>[pg 353]</span>
left, then raise the right and throw it forcibly over and downward in
front of the left&mdash;<i>brave</i>, <i>strong</i>. See Fig. 242, page <a href="#page415">415</a>.</p>

<p>The Arikaras make the sign for <i>brave</i> by striking the clinched fist
forcibly toward the ground in front of and near the breast.</p>

<p>Brave, or "strong-hearted," is made by the Absaroka, Shoshoni, and
Banak Indians by merely placing the clinched fist to the breast, the
latter having allusion to the heart, the clinching of the hand to strength,
vigor, or force.</p>

<p>An Ojibwa sign for <i>death, to die</i>, is as follows:</p>

<p>Place the palm of the hand at a short distance from the side of the
head, then withdraw it gently in an oblique downward direction, inclining
the head and upper part of the body in the same direction.</p>

<p>The same authority, The Very Rev. E. Jacker, who contributes it,
notes that there is an apparent connection between this conception and
execution and the etymology of the corresponding terms in Ojibwa.
"He dies," is <i>nibo</i>; "he sleeps," is <i>niba</i>. The common idea
expressed
by the gesture is a sinking to rest. The original significance of the root
<i>nib</i> seems to be "leaning;" <i>anibeia</i>, "it is leaning";
<i>anibekweni</i>, "he inclines
the head sidewards." The word <i>niba</i> or <i>nibe</i> (only in
compounds)
conveys the idea of "night," perhaps as the falling over, the going to
rest, or the death of the day.</p>

<p><i>Ogima</i>, the Ojibwa term for <i>chief</i>, is derived from a root
which signifies
"above" (<i>Ogidjaii</i>, upon; <i>ogidjina</i>, above; <i>ogidaki</i>, on
a hill or mountain,
etc.). <i>Ogitchida</i>, a brave, a hero (Otawa, <i>ogida</i>), is probably
from the same root.</p>

<p><i>Sagima</i>, the Ojibwa form of sachem, is from the root <i>sag</i>,
which implies
a coming forth, or stretching out. These roots are to be considered in
connection with several gestures described under the head of <i>Chief</i>,
in <span class="sc">Extracts from Dictionary</span>, <i>infra</i>.</p>

<p><i>Onijishin</i>, it is <i>good</i> (<i>Ojibwa</i>), originally signifies
"it lies level." This
may be compared with the sign for <i>good</i>, in the Tendoy-Huerito
Dialogue,
Fig. 309, page <a href="#page487">487</a>, and also that for <i>happy</i>, <i>contentment</i>, in
the Speech
of Kin Ch&#275;-&#277;ss, page <a href="#page523">523</a>.</p>

<p>In Klamath the radix <i>lam</i> designates a whirling motion, and appears
in the word <i>l&#225;ma</i>, "to be crazy, mad," readily correlated with the
common
gesture for <i>madman</i> and <i>fool</i>, in which the hand is rotated
above
and near the head.</p>

<p><i>Evening</i>, in Klamath, is <i>litkh&#237;</i>, from <i>luta</i>, to hang
down, meaning the
time when the sun hangs down, the gesture for which, described elsewhere
in this paper (see N&#225;tci's Narrative, page <a href="#page503">503</a>), is executive of the
same conception, which is allied to the etymology usually given for
<i>eve</i>,
<i>even</i>, "the decline of the day." These Klamath etymologies have been
kindly contributed by Mr. A.S. Gatschet.</p>

<p>The Very Rev. E. Jacker also communicates a suggestive <i>excursus
exegeticus</i> upon the probable gestural origin of the Ojibwa word
<i>tibishko</i>, "opposite in space; just so; likewise:"</p>

<p>"The adverb <i>tibishko</i> (or <i>dibishko</i>) is an offshoot of the root
<i>tib</i> (or <i>dib</i>),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>[pg 354]</span>
which in most cases conveys the idea of measuring or weighing, as appears
from the following samples: <i>dibaige</i>, he measures; <i>dibowe</i>, he
settles
matters by his speech or word, <i>e.g.</i>, as a juryman; <i>dibaamage</i>, he
pays out; <i>dibakonige</i>, he judges; <i>dibabishkodjige</i>, he weighs;
<i>dibamenimo</i>,
he restricts himself, <i>e.g.</i>, to a certain quantity of food;
<i>dibissitchige</i>, he
fulfills a promise; <i>dibijigan</i>, a pattern for cutting clothes.</p>

<p>"The original, meaning of <i>tib</i>, however, must be supposed to have
been more comprehensive, if we would explain other (apparent) derivatives,
such as: <i>tibi</i>, 'I don't know where, where to, where from,' &amp;c.;
<i>tibik</i>, night; <i>dibendjige</i>, he is master or owner;
<i>titibisse</i>, it rolls (as a ball),
it turns (as a wheel); <i>dibaboweigan</i>, the cover of a kettle. The
notion
of measuring does not very naturally enter into the ideas expressed
by these terms.</p>

<p>"The difficulty disappears if we assume the root <i>tib</i> or <i>dib</i>
to have
been originally the phonetic equivalent of a <i>gesture</i> expressive of
the notion of covering as well as of that of measuring. This gesture would
seem to be the holding of one hand above the other, horizontally, at
some distance, palms opposite or both downwards. This, or some similar
gesture would most naturally accompany the above terms. As for
<i>tibik</i>, night, compare (<i>Dunbar</i>): 'The two hands open and
extended,
crossing one another horizontally.' The idea of covering evidently enters
into this conception. The strange adverb <i>tibi</i> ('I don't know
where,' &amp;c., or 'in a place unknown to me'), if derived from the same
root, would originally signify 'covered.' In <i>titibisse</i>, or
<i>didibisse</i> (it rolls,
it turns), the reduplication of the radical syllable indicates the
repetition
of the gesture, by holding the hands alternately above one another,
palms downwards, and thus producing a rotary motion.</p>

<p>"In German, the clasping of the hands in a horizontal position, expressive
of a promise or the conclusion of a bargain, is frequently
accompanied by the interjection <i>top!</i> the same radical consonants as
in <i>tib</i>. Compare also the English <i>tap</i>, the French <i>tape</i>,
the Greek, &tau;&upsilon;&pi;&tau;&omega; the Sanscrit <i>tup</i> and <i>tub</i>, &amp;c."</p>


<h4>GESTURES CONNECTED WITH THE ORIGIN OF WRITING.</h4>

<p>Though written characters are generally associated with speech, they
are shown, by successful employment in hieroglyphs and by educated
deaf-mutes to be representative of ideas without the intervention of
sounds, and so also are the outlines of signs. This will be more apparent
if the motions expressing the most prominent feature, attribute,
or function of an object are made, or supposed to be made, so as to
leave a luminous track impressible upon the eye separate from the members
producing it. The actual result is an immateriate graphic representation
of visible objects and qualities which, invested with substance,
has become familiar to us as the <i>rebus</i>, and also appears in the
form of heraldic blazonry styled punning or "canting."</p>

<p>Gesture language is, in fact, not only a picture language, but is actual
writing, though dissolving and sympathetic, and neither alphabetic nor
phonetic.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>[pg 355]</span>

<p>Dalgarno aptly says: "<i>Qui enim caput nutat, oculo connivet, digitum
movet in a&#235;re, &amp;c., (ad mentis cogitata exprimendum); is non minus vere
scribit, quam qui Literas pingit in Charta, Marmore, vel &#230;re.</i>"</p>

<p>It is neither necessary nor proper to enter now upon any prolonged
account of the origin, of alphabetic writing. There is, however, propriety,
if not necessity, for the present writer, when making any remarks
under this heading and under some others in this paper indicating special
lines of research, to disclaim all pretension to being a Sinologue or
Egyptologist, or even profoundly versed in Mexican antiquities. His
partial and recently commenced studies only enable him to present
suggestions
for the examination of scholars. These suggestions may safely
be introduced by the statement that the common modern alphabetic
characters, coming directly from the Romans, were obtained by them
from the Greeks, and by the latter from the Ph&oelig;nicians, whose alphabet
was connected with that of the old Hebrew. It has also been of
late the general opinion that the whole family of alphabets to which
the Greek, Latin, Gothic, Runic, and others belong, appearing earlier in
the Ph&oelig;nician, Moabite, and Hebrew, had its beginning in the ideographic
pictures of the Egyptians, afterwards used by them to express
sounds. That the Chinese, though in a different manner from the
Egyptians, passed from picture writing to phonetic writing, is established
by delineations still extant among them, called <i>ku-w&#259;n</i>, or "ancient
pictures,"
with which some of the modern written characters can be identified.
The ancient Mexicans also, to some extent, developed phonetic
expressions out of a very elaborate system of ideographic picture writing.
Assuming that ideographic pictures made by ancient peoples would be
likely to contain representations of gesture signs, which subject is
treated
of below, it is proper to examine if traces of such gesture signs may not
be found in the Egyptian, Chinese, and Aztec characters. Only a few
presumptive examples, selected from a considerable number, are now
presented in which the signs of the North American Indians appear to
be included, with the hope that further investigation by collaborators will
establish many more instances not confined to Indian signs.</p>

<p>A typical sign made by the Indians for <i>no</i>, <i>negation</i>, is as
follows:
The hand extended or slightly curved is held in front of the body, a
little to the right of the median line; it is then carried with a rapid
sweep a foot or more farther to the right. (<i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i> I.)</p>

<p>One for <i>none</i>, <i>nothing</i>, sometimes used for simple negation, is
also
given: Throw both hands outward toward their respective
sides from the breast. (<i>Wyandot</i> I.)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:25%;"><a href="images/fig118.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig118.png" alt="No, negation. Egyptian" /></a>Fig. 118.</div>

<p>With these compare the two forms of the Egyptian
character for <i>no</i>, <i>negation</i>, Fig. 118, taken from Champollion,
<i>Grammaire &#201;gyptienne</i>, <i>Paris</i>, 1836, p. 519.</p>

<p>No vivid fancy is needed to see the hands indicated at the extremities
of arms extended symmetrically from the body on each side.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>[pg 356]</span>

<div class="figleft" style="width:15%;"><a href="images/fig119.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig119.png" alt="Negation. Maya" /></a>Fig. 119.</div>

<p>Also compare the Maya character for the same idea of negation,
Fig. 119, found in Landa, <i>Relation des Choses de Yucatan</i>, <i>Paris</i>,
1864, 316.
The Maya word for negation is "<i>ma</i>," and the word "<i>mak</i>," a
six-foot
measuring rod, given by Brasseur de Bourbourg in his
dictionary, apparently having connection with this character,
would in use separate the hands as illustrated, giving the
same form as the gesture made without the rod.</p>

<p>Another sign for <i>nothing</i>, <i>none</i>, made by the Comanches, is:
Flat hand
thrown forward, back to the ground, fingers pointing forward and downward.
Frequently the right hand is brushed over the left thus thrown
out.</p>

<div class="figrightno" style="width:9%;"><a href="images/fig120.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig120.png" alt="Nothing. Chinese" /></a>Fig. 120.</div>

<p>Compare the Chinese character for the same meaning, Fig. 120.
This will not be recognized as a hand without study of similar
characters, which generally have a cross-line cutting off the
wrist. Here the wrist bones follow under the cross cut, then
the metacarpal bones, and last the fingers, pointing
forward and downward.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:16%;"><a href="images/fig121.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig121.png" alt="Child. Egyptian figurative" /></a>Fig. 121.</div>

<div class="figleftno" style="width:10%;"><a href="images/fig122.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig122.png" alt="Child. Egyptian linear" /></a>Fig. 122.</div>

<div class="figleftno" style="width:11%;"><a href="images/fig123.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig123.png" alt="Child. Egyptian hieratic" /></a>Fig. 123.</div>

<p>The Arapaho sign for <i>child</i>, <i>baby</i>, is the forefinger
in the mouth, <i>i.e.</i>, a nursing child, and a natural sign
of a deaf-mute is the same. The Egyptian figurative character for the
same is seen in Fig. 121. Its linear form is Fig. 122, and its hieratic is
Fig. 123 (Champollion, <i>Dictionnaire Egyptien</i>, <i>Paris</i>,
1841, p. 31.)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:8%;"><a href="images/fig126.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig126.png" alt="Birth. Chinese character" /></a>Fig. 126.</div>

<div class="figrightno" style="width:10%;"><a href="images/fig125.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig125.png" alt="Son. Modern Chinese" /></a>Fig. 125.</div>

<div class="figrightno" style="width:7%;"><a href="images/fig124.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig124.png" alt="Son. Ancient Chinese" /></a>Fig. 124.</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width:48%;"><a href="images/fig127.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig127.png" alt="Birth. Dakota" /></a>Fig. 127.</div>

<p>These afford an interpretation to the ancient Chinese
form for <i>son</i>, Fig. 124, given in <i>Journ. Royal Asiatic
Society</i>, I, 1834, p. 219, as belonging to the Shang dynasty,
1756, 1112 B.C., and the modern Chinese form, Fig. 125, which,
without the comparison, would not be supposed to have any pictured
reference to an infant with hand or finger at or
approaching the mouth, denoting the taking of
nourishment. Having now suggested this, the
Chinese character for <i>birth</i>, Fig. 126, is understood
as the expression of a common gesture among the Indians, particularly
reported from the Dakota, for <i>born</i>, <i>to be born</i>, viz: Place
the left hand
in front of the body, a little to the
right, the palm downward and slightly
arched, then pass the extended right
hand downward, forward, and upward,
forming a short curve underneath the
left, as in Fig. 127 (<i>Dakota</i> V). This
is based upon the curve followed by
the head of the child during birth,
and is used generically. The same
curve, when made with one hand, appears
in Fig. 128.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:38%;"><a href="images/fig128.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig128.png" alt="Birth, generic. N.A. Indians" /></a>Fig. 128.</div>

<p>It may be of interest to compare with the Chinese <i>child</i> the Mexican
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>[pg 357]</span>
abbreviated character for <i>man</i>, Fig. 129, found in Pipart in
<i>Compte Rendu
Cong. Inter. des Am&#233;ricanistes, 2<sup>me</sup>
Session</i>, <i>Luxembourg</i>, 1877, 1878,
II, 359. The figure on the right is called the abbreviated form of that
by its side, yet its origin may be different.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:10%;"><a href="images/fig129.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig129.png" alt="Man. Mexican" /></a>Fig. 129.</div>

<div class="figleftno" style="width:10%;"><a href="images/fig130.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig130.png" alt="Man. Chinese character" /></a>Fig. 130.</div>

<div class="figleftno" style="width:10%;"><a href="images/fig131.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig131.png" alt="Woman. Chinese character" /></a>Fig. 131.</div>

<p>The Chinese character for <i>man</i>, is Fig. 130, and may have the same
obvious conception as a Dakota
sign for the same signification:
"Place the extended index, pointing
upward and forward before the
lower portion of the abdomen."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:15%;"><a href="images/fig132.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig132.png" alt="Woman. Ute" /></a>Fig. 132.</div>

<p>The Chinese specific character for <i>woman</i>
is Fig. 131, the cross mark denoting
the wrist, and if the remainder
be considered the hand,
the fingers may be imagined in the
position made by many tribes, and especially
the Utes, as depicting the
<i>pudendum muliebre</i>, Fig. 132.</p>
<p>The Egyptian generic character
for <i>female</i> is <a href="images/semicircle.png"><img width="40" src="images/semicircle.png" alt="semicircle" border="0" align="middle" /></a> (Champollion, <i>Dict.</i>,) believed
to represent the curve of
the mamm&#230; supposed to be cut off or separated from the chest, and
the gesture with the same meaning was made by the Cheyenne
Titchkematski, and photographed, as in Fig. 133. It forms
the same figure as the Egyptian character as well as can be
done by a position of the human hand.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/fig133.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig133.png" alt="Female, generic. Cheyenne" /></a>Fig. 133.</div>

<div class="figleftno" style="width:10%;"><a href="images/fig134.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig134.png" alt="To give water. Chinese character" /></a>Fig. 134.</div>

<p>The Chinese character for <i>to give water</i>
is Fig. 134, which may be compared with
the common Indian gesture <i>to drink</i>, <i>to give
water</i>, viz: "Hand held with tips of fingers
brought together and passed to the mouth,
as if scooping up water", Fig. 135, obviously from the primitive custom,
as with Mojaves, who still drink with scooped hands.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:15%;"><a href="images/fig135.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig135.png" alt="Water, to drink. N.A. Indian" /></a>Fig. 135.</div>

<p>Another common Indian gesture sign for <i>water to drink</i>, <i>I want to
drink</i>,
is: "Hand brought downward past the mouth with loosely extended
fingers, palm toward the face." This appears in the Mexican character
for <i>drink</i>, Fig. 136, taken from Pipart, <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 351.
<i>Water</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the pouring out of water with the drops falling
or about to fall, is shown in Fig. 137, taken from the
same author (p. 349), being the same arrangement of
them as in the sign for <i>rain</i>, Fig. 114, p. <a href="#page344">344</a>, the hand, however,
being inverted. <i>Rain</i> in the Mexican
picture writing is shown by small circles
inclosing a dot, as in the last two figures,
but not connected together, each having
a short line upward marking the line of descent.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:10%;"><a href="images/fig136.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig136.png" alt="Drink. Mexican" /></a>Fig. 136.</div>

<p>With the gesture for drink may be compared Fig. 138, the Egyptian
Goddess Nu in the sacred sycamore tree, pouring out the water of life
to the Osirian and his soul, represented as a bird, in Amenti (Sharpe,
from a funereal stele in the British Museum,
in <i>Cooper's Serpent Myths</i>, p. 43).</p>

<p>The common Indian gesture for <i>river</i>
or <i>stream</i>, <i>water</i>, is made by passing the
horizontal flat hand, palm down, forward
and to the left from the right side in a
serpentine manner.</p>

<p>The Egyptian character for the same
is Fig. 139 (Champollion, <i>Dict.</i>, p. 429).
The broken line is held to represent the
movement of the water on the surface of
the stream. When made with one line less angular and more waving
it means <i>water</i>. It is interesting to compare with this the identical
character in the syllabary invented by a West African negro,
Mormoru Doalu Bukere, for <i>water</i>, <a href="images/water.png"><img width="60" src="images/water.png" alt="water" border="0" align="middle" /></a>, mentioned
by <span class="sc">Tylor</span> in his <i>Early History of Mankind</i>, p. 103.</p>

<p>The abbreviated Egyptian sign for <i>water</i> as a stream
is Fig. 140 (Champollion, <i>loc. cit.</i>), and the Chinese for the same
is as in Fig. 141.</p>

<p>In the picture-writing of the Ojibwa the Egyptian abbreviated character,
with two lines instead of three, appears with the same signification.</p>

<p>The Egyptian character for <i>weep</i>, Fig. 142, an eye,
with tears falling, is also found in the pictographs of
the Ojibwa (Schoolcraft, I, pl. 54, Fig. 27), and is also
made by the Indian gesture of drawing lines by the index repeatedly
downward from the eye, though perhaps more frequently made by
the full sign for <i>rain</i>, described on page <a href="#page344">344</a>, made with the
back of the hand downward from the eye&mdash;"eye rain."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:15%;"><a href="images/fig142.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig142.png" alt="To weep. Ojibwa pictograph" /></a>Fig. 142.</div>

<p>The Egyptian character for <i>to be strong</i> is Fig. 143 (Champollion,
<i>Dict.</i>, p. 91), which is sufficiently
obvious, but may be compared with the sign for <i>strong</i>, made by some
tribes as follows: Hold the clinched fist in front of the right side, a
little
higher than the elbow, then throw it forcibly about six inches toward
the ground.</p>

<p>A typical gesture for <i>night</i> is as follows: Place the flat hands,
horizontally,
about two feet apart, move them quickly in an upward curve
toward one another until the right lies across the left. "Darkness covers
all." See Fig. 312, page <a href="#page489">489</a>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/fig144.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig144.png" alt="Night. Egyptian" /></a>Fig. 144.</div>

<p>The conception of covering executed by delineating
the object covered beneath the middle
point of an arch or curve, appears also clearly in
the Egyptian characters for <i>night</i>, Fig. 144 (Champollion,
<i>Dict.</i>, p. 3).</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>[pg 359]</span>

<p>The upper part of the character is taken separately to form that for
sky (see page <a href="#page372">372</a>, <i>infra</i>).</p>

<p>The Egyptian figurative and linear characters, Figs. 145 and 146
(Champollion, <i>Dict.</i>, p. 28), for <i>calling upon</i> and
<i>invocation</i>, also
used as an interjection, scarcely require the quotation of an Indian
sign, being common all over the world.</p>

<p>The gesture sign made by several tribes for <i>many</i>
is as follows: Both hands, with spread and slightly
curved fingers, are held pendent about two feet apart
before the thighs; then bring them toward one another,
horizontally, drawing them upward as they come together. (<i>Absaroka</i>
I; <i>Shoshoni and Banak</i> I; <i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> III;
<i>Apache</i> II; <i>Wichita</i>
II.) "An accumulation of objects." This may be the same motion indicated by
the Egyptian character, Fig. 147, meaning to <i>gather together</i>
(Champollion, <i>Dict.</i>, p. 459).</p>

<p>The Egyptian character, Fig. 148, which in its linear
form is represented in Fig. 149, and meaning to <i>go</i>, to <i>come</i>,
<i>locomotion</i>, is presented to show readers unfamiliar with
hieroglyphics
how a corporeal action may be included in a linear character without
being obvious or at least certain, unless it should be made clear by
comparison
with the full figurative form or by other means. This
linear form might be noticed many times without certainty or
perhaps suspicion that it represented the human legs and feet in the
act of walking. The same difficulty, of course, as also the same prospect
of success by careful research, attends the tracing of other corporeal
motions which more properly come under the head of gesture signs.</p>



<h3><i>SIGN LANGUAGE WITH REFERENCE TO GRAMMAR.</i></h3>

<p>Apart from the more material and substantive relations between signs
and language, it is to be expected that analogies can by proper research
be ascertained between their several developments in the manner of
their use, that is, in their grammatic mechanism, and in the genesis of
the sentence. The science of language, ever henceforward to be studied
historically, must take account of the similar early mental processes in
which the phrase or sentence originated, both in sign and oral utterance.
In this respect, as in many others, the North American Indians may be
considered to be living representatives of prehistoric man.</p>


<h4>SYNTAX.</h4>

<p>The reader will understand without explanation that there is in the
gesture speech no organized sentence such as is integrated in the languages
of civilization, and that he must not look for articles or particles
or passive voice or case or grammatic gender, or even what appears in
those languages as a substantive or a verb, as a subject or a predicate,
or as qualifiers or inflexions. The sign radicals, without being
specifically
any of our parts of speech, may be all of them in turn. There is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>[pg 360]</span>
however, a grouping and sequence of the ideographic pictures, an
arrangement
of signs in connected succession, which may be classed under the
scholastic head of syntax. This subject, with special reference to the
order of deaf-mute signs as compared with oral speech, has been the
theme of much discussion, some notes of which, condensed from the
speculations of M. R&#233;mi Valade and others, follow in the next paragraph
without further comment than may invite attention to the profound
remark of <span class="sc">Leibnitz</span>.</p>

<p>In mimic construction there are to be considered both the order in
which the signs succeed one another and the relative positions in which
they are made, the latter remaining longer in the memory than the
former, and spoken language may sometimes in its early infancy have
reproduced the ideas of a sign picture without commencing from the
same point. So the order, as in Greek and Latin, is very variable. In
nations among whom the alphabet was introduced without the intermediary
to any impressive degree of picture-writing, the order being (1)
language of signs, almost superseded by (2) spoken language, and (3)
alphabetic writing, men would write in the order in which they had
been accustomed to speak. But if at a time when spoken language
was still rudimentary, intercourse being mainly carried on by signs,
figurative writing had been invented, the order of the figures would be
the order of the signs, and the same order would pass into the spoken
language. Hence <span class="sc">Leibnitz</span> says truly that "the writing of the Chinese
might seem to have been invented by a deaf person." The oral language
has not known the phases which have given to the Indo-European
tongues their formation and grammatical parts. In the latter, signs
were conquered by speech, while in the former, speech received the yoke.</p>

<p>Sign language cannot show by inflection the reciprocal dependence of
words and sentences. Degrees of motion corresponding with vocal intonation
are only used rhetorically or for degrees of comparison. The
relations of ideas and objects are therefore expressed by placement, and
their connection is established when necessary by the abstraction of
ideas. The sign talker is an artist, grouping persons and things so as
to show the relations between them, and the effect is that which is seen
in a picture. But though the artist has the advantage in presenting in
a permanent connected scene the result of several transient signs, he can
only present it as it appears at a single moment. The sign talker has
the succession of time at his disposal, and his scenes move and act, are
localized and animated, and their arrangement is therefore more varied
and significant.</p>

<p>It is not satisfactory to give the order of equivalent words as
representative
of the order of signs, because the pictorial arrangement is
wholly lost; but adopting this expedient as a mere illustration of the
sequence in the presentation of signs by deaf-mutes, the following is
quoted from an essay by Rev. J.R. Keep, in <i>American Annals of the Deaf and Dumb</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>[pg 361]</span>
vol. xvi, p. 223, as the order in which the parable
of the Prodigal Son is translated into signs:</p>

<p>"Once, man one, sons two. Son younger say, Father property your
divide: part my, me give. Father so.&mdash;Son each, part his give. Days
few after, son younger money all take, country far go, money spend,
wine drink, food nice eat. Money by and by gone all. Country everywhere
food little: son hungry very. Go seek man any, me hire. Gentleman
meet. Gentleman son send field swine feed. Son swine husks
eat, see&mdash;self husks eat want&mdash;cannot&mdash;husks him give nobody. Son
thinks, say, father my, servants many, bread enough, part give away
can&mdash;I none&mdash;starve, die. I decide: Father I go to, say I bad, God disobey,
you disobey&mdash;name my hereafter <i>son</i>, no&mdash;I unworthy. You me
work give servant like. So son begin go. Father far look: son see,
pity, run, meet, embrace. Son father say, I bad, you disobey, God
disobey&mdash;name
my hereafter <i>son</i>, no&mdash;I unworthy. But father servants call,
command robe best bring, son put on, ring finger put on, shoes feet put
on, calf fat bring, kill. We all eat, merry. Why? Son this my formerly
dead, now alive: formerly lost, now found: rejoice."</p>

<p>It may be remarked, not only from this example, but from general
study, that the verb "to be" as a copula or predicant does not have any
place in sign language. It is shown, however, among deaf-mutes as
an assertion of presence or existence by a sign of stretching the arms
and hands forward and then adding the sign of affirmation. <i>Time</i> as
referred to in the conjunctions <i>when</i> and <i>then</i> is not
gestured. Instead of
the form, "When I have had a sleep I will go to the river," or "After
sleeping I will go to the river," both deaf-mutes and Indians would express
the intention by "Sleep done, I river go." Though time present,
past, and future is readily expressed in signs (see page <a href="#page366">366</a>), it is done
once for all in the connection to which it belongs, and once established
is not repeated by any subsequent intimation, as is commonly the case
in oral speech. Inversion, by which the object is placed before the action,
is a striking feature of the language of deaf-mutes, and it appears
to follow the natural method by which objects and actions enter into
the mental conception. In striking a rock the natural conception is
not first of the abstract idea of striking or of sending a stroke into
vacancy, seeing nothing and having no intention of striking anything
in particular, when suddenly a rock rises up to the mental vision and
receives the blow; the order is that the man sees the rock, has the
intention
to strike it, and does so; therefore he gestures, "I rock strike." For
further illustration of this subject, a deaf-mute boy, giving in signs the
compound action of a man shooting a bird from a tree, first represented
the tree, then the bird as alighting upon it, then a hunter coming toward
and looking at it, taking aim with a gun, then the report of the latter
and the falling and the dying gasps of the bird. These are undoubtedly
the successive steps that an artist would have taken in drawing the
picture,
or rather successive pictures, to illustrate the story. It is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>[pg 362]</span>
however, urged that this pictorial order natural to deaf-mutes is not
natural
to the congenitally blind who are not deaf-mute, among whom it is found
to be rhythmical. It is asserted that blind persons not carefully educated
usually converse in a metrical cadence, the action usually coming first
in the structure of the sentence. The deduction is that all the senses
when intact enter into the mode of intellectual conception in proportion
to their relative sensitiveness and intensity, and hence no one mode of
ideation can be insisted on as normal to the exclusion of others.</p>

<p>Whether or not the above statement concerning the blind is true, the
conceptions and presentations of deaf-mutes and of Indians using sign
language because they cannot communicate by speech, are confined to
optic and, therefore, to pictorial arrangement.</p>

<p>The abb&#233; Sicard, dissatisfied with the want of tenses and conjunctions,
indeed of most of the modern parts of speech, in the natural signs,
and with their inverted order, attempted to construct a new language
of signs, in which the words should be given in the order of the French
or other spoken language adopted, which of course required him to supply
a sign for every word of spoken language. Signs, whatever their
character, could not become associated with words, or suggest them,
until words had been learned. The first step, therefore, was to explain
by means of natural signs, as distinct from the new signs styled
methodical,
the meaning of a passage of verbal language. Then each word was
taken separately and a sign affixed to it, which was to be learned by the
pupil. If the word represented a physical object, the sign would be the
same as the natural sign, and would be already understood, provided
the object had been seen and was familiar; and in all cases the endeavor
was to have the sign convey as strong a suggestion of the meaning
of the word as was possible. The final step was to gesticulate these
signs, thus associated with words, in the exact order in which the words
were to stand in a sentence. Then the pupil would write the very
words desired in the exact order desired. If the previous explanation
in natural signs had not been sufficiently full and careful, he would not
understand the passage. The methodical signs did not profess to give
him the ideas, except in a very limited degree, but only to show him
how to express ideas according to the order and methods of spoken language.
As there were no repetitions of time in narratives in the sign
language, it became necessary to unite with the word-sign for verbs
others, to indicate the different tenses of the verbs, and so by degrees
the methodical signs not only were required to comprise signs for
every word, but also, with every such sign, a grammatical sign to indicate
what part of speech the word was, and, in the case of verbs, still
other signs to show their tenses and corresponding inflections. It was,
as Dr. Peet remarks, a cumbrous and unwieldly vehicle, ready at every
step to break down under the weight of its own machinery. Nevertheless,
it was industriously taught in all our schools from the date of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>[pg 363]</span>
founding of the American Asylum in 1817 down to about the year 1835, when
it was abandoned.</p>

<p>The collection of narratives, speeches, and dialogues of our Indians in
sign language, first systematically commenced by the present writer,
several examples of which are in this paper, has not yet been sufficiently
complete and exact to establish conclusions on the subject of the syntactic
arrangement of their signs. So far as studied it seems to be similar to
that of deaf-mutes and to retain the characteristic of pantomimes in
figuring first the principal idea and adding the accessories successively
in the order of importance, the ideographic expressions being in the
ideologic
order. If the examples given are not enough to establish general
rules of construction, they at least show the natural order of ideas in
the minds of the gesturers and the several modes of inversion by which
they pass from the known to the unknown, beginning with the dominant
idea or that supposed to be best known. Some special instances of
expedients other than strictly syntactic coming under the machinery
broadly designated as grammar may be mentioned.</p>


<h4>DEGREES OF COMPARISON.</h4>

<p>Degrees of comparison are frequently expressed, both by deaf-mutes
and by Indians, by adding to the generic or descriptive sign that for
"big" or "little." <i>Damp</i> would be "wet&mdash;little"; <i>cool</i>,
"cold&mdash;little"; <i>hot</i>,
"warm&mdash;much." The amount or force of motion also often indicates
corresponding
diminution or augmentation, but sometimes expresses a different
shade of meaning, as is reported by Dr. Matthews with reference
to the sign for <i>bad</i> and <i>contempt</i>, see page <a href="#page411">411</a>. This change
in degree of
motion is, however, often used for emphasis only, as is the raising of the
voice in speech or italicizing and capitalizing in print. The Prince of
Wied gives an instance of a comparison in his sign for <i>excessively
hard</i>,
first giving that for <i>hard</i>, viz: Open the left hand, and strike
against it
several times with the right (with the backs of the fingers). Afterwards
he gives <i>hard, excessively</i>, as follows: Sign for <i>hard</i>, then
place the
left index-finger upon the right shoulder, at the same time extend and
raise the right arm high, extending the index-finger upward,
perpendicularly.</p>

<p>Rev. G.L. Deffenbaugh describes what may perhaps be regarded as
an intensive sign among the Sahaptins in connection with the sign for
<i>good</i>; <i>i.e.</i>, <i>very good</i>. "Place the left hand in position in
front of the body
with all fingers closed except first, thumb lying on second, then with
forefinger of right hand extended in same way point to end of forefinger
of left hand, move it up the arm till near the body and then to a
point in front of breast to make the sign <i>good</i>." For the latter see
<span class="sc">Extracts from Dictionary</span> page <a href="#page487">487</a>, <i>infra</i>. The same special motion
is prefixed to the sign for <i>bad</i> as an intensive.</p>

<p>Another intensive is reported by Mr. Benjamin Clark, interpreter at
the Kaiowa, Comanche, and Wichita agency, Indian Territory, in which
after the sign for <i>bad</i> is made, that for <i>strong</i> is used by
the Comanches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>[pg 364]</span>
as follows: Place the clinched left fist horizontally in front of the
breast,
back forward, then pass the palmar side of the right fist downward in
front of the knuckles of the left.</p>

<p>Dr. W.H. Corbusier, assistant surgeon U.S.A., writes as follows
in response to a special inquiry on the subject: "By carrying the right
fist from behind forward over the left, instead of beginning the motion
six inches above it, the Arapaho sign for <i>strong</i> is made. For
<i>brave</i>,
first strike the chest over the heart with the right fist two or three
times, and then make the sign for <i>strong</i>.</p>

<p>"The sign for <i>strong</i> expresses the superlative when used with other
signs; with coward it denotes a base coward; with hunger, starvation;
and with sorrow, bitter sorrow. I have not seen it used with the sign for
pleasure or that of hunger, nor can I learn that it is ever used with them."</p>


<h4>OPPOSITION.</h4>

<p>The principle of opposition, as between the right and left hands, and
between the thumb and forefinger and the little finger, appears among
Indians in some expressions for "above," "below," "forward," "back,"
but is not so common as among the methodical, distinguished from the
natural, signs of deaf-mutes. It is also connected with the attempt to
express degrees of comparison. <i>Above</i> is sometimes expressed by
holding the left hand horizontal, and in front of the body, fingers open,
but joined together, palm upward. The right hand is then placed horizontal,
fingers open but joined, palm downward, an inch or more above
the left, and raised and lowered a few inches several times, the left hand
being perfectly still. If the thing indicated as "above" is only a
<i>little</i>
above, this concludes the sign, but if it be <i>considerably</i> above, the
right
hand is raised higher and higher as the height to be expressed is greater,
until, if <i>enormously</i> above, the Indian will raise his right hand as
high
as possible, and, fixing his eyes on the zenith, emit a duplicate grunt,
the more prolonged as he desires to express the greater height. All
this time the left hand is held perfectly motionless. <i>Below</i> is
gestured
in a corresponding manner, all movement being made by the left or
lower hand, the right being held motionless, palm downward, and the
eyes looking down.</p>

<p>The code of the Cistercian monks was based in large part on a system
of opposition which seems to have been wrought out by an elaborate process
of invention rather than by spontaneous figuration, and is more of
mnemonic than suggestive value. They made two fingers at the right
side of the nose stand for "friend," and the same at the left side for
"enemy," by some fanciful connection with right and wrong, and placed
the little finger on the tip of the nose for "fool" merely because it had
been decided to put the forefinger there for "wise man."</p>


<h4>PROPER NAMES.</h4>

<p>It is well known that the names of Indians are almost always connotive,
and particularly that they generally refer to some animal, predicating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>[pg 365]</span>
often some attribute or position of that animal. Such names readily admit
of being expressed in sign language, but there may be sometimes a
confusion between the sign expressing the animal which is taken as a
name-totem, and the sign used, not to designate that animal, but as a
proper name. A curious device to differentiate proper names was observed
as resorted to by a Brul&#233; Dakota. After making the sign of the
animal he passed his index forward from the mouth in a direct line,
and explained it orally as "that is his name," <i>i.e.</i>, the name of the person
referred to. This approach to a grammatic division of substantives
maybe correlated with the mode in which many tribes, especially the
Dakotas, designate names in their pictographs, <i>i.e.</i>, by a line from the
mouth of the figure drawn representing a man to the animal, also drawn
with proper color or position. Fig. 150 thus shows the name of
Shun-ka Luta, Red Dog, an Ogallalla chief, drawn by himself.
The shading of the dog by vertical lines is designed
to represent red, or <i>gules</i>, according to the heraldic
scheme of colors, which is used in other parts
of this paper where it seemed useful to designate
particular colors. The writer possesses in painted robes many examples
in which lines are drawn from the mouth to a name-totem.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:60%;"><a href="images/fig150.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig150.png" alt="Shun'-ka Lu'-ta. Dakota" /></a>Fig. 150.</div>

<p>It would be interesting to dwell more than is now allowed upon the
peculiar objectiveness of Indian proper names with the result, if not
the intention, that they can all be signified in gesture, whereas the
best sign-talker among deaf-mutes is unable to translate the proper
names occurring in his speech or narrative and, necessarily ceasing
signs, resorts to the dactylic alphabet. Indians are generally named
at first according to a clan or totemic system, but later in life often
acquire
a new name or perhaps several names in succession from some exploit
or adventure. Frequently a sobriquet is given by no means complimentary.
All of the subsequently acquired, as well as the original
names, are connected with material objects or with substantive actions
so as to be expressible in a graphic picture, and, therefore, in a
pictorial
sign. The determination to use names of this connotive character is
shown by the objective translation, whenever possible, of those European
names which it became necessary to introduce into their speech. William
Penn was called "Onas," that being the word for feather-quill in the
Mohawk dialect. The name of the second French governor of Canada
was "Montmagny" which was translated by the Iroquois "Onontio"&mdash;"Great
Mountain," and becoming associated with the title, has been
applied to all successive Canadian governors, though the origin being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>[pg 366]</span>
generally forgotten, it has been considered as a metaphorical compliment.
It is also said that Governor Fletcher was not named by the
Iroquois "Cajenquiragoe," "the great swift arrow," because of his speedy
arrival at a critical time, but because they had somehow been informed
of the etymology of his name&mdash;"arrow maker" (<i>Fr. fl&#233;chier</i>).</p>


<h4>GENDER.</h4>

<p>This is sometimes expressed by different signs to distinguish the sex of
animals, when the difference in appearance allows of such varied
portraiture.
An example is in the signs for the male and female buffalo, given by
the Prince of Wied. The former is, "Place the tightly closed hands on
both sides of the head, with the fingers forward;" the latter is,
"Curve the
two forefingers, place them on the sides of the head and move them several
times." The short stubby horns of the bull appear to be indicated, and
the cow's ears are seen moving, not being covered by the bull's shock
mane. Tribes in which the hair of the women is differently arranged
from that of men often denote their females by corresponding gesture.
In many cases the sex of animals is indicated by the addition of a generic
sign for male or female.</p>


<h4>TENSE.</h4>

<p>While it has been mentioned that there is no inflection of signs to
express
tense, yet the conception of present, past, and future is gestured
without difficulty. A common mode of indicating the present time is
by the use of signs for <i>to-day</i>, one of which is, "(1) both hands
extended,
palms outward; (2) swept slowly forward and to each side, to convey
the idea of openness." (<i>Cheyenne</i> II.) This may combine the idea of
<i>now</i> with <i>openness</i>, the first part of it resembling the
general deaf-mute
sign for <i>here</i> or <i>now</i>.</p>

<p>Two signs nearly related together are also reported as expressing the
meaning <i>now, at once</i>, viz.: "Forefinger of the right hand extended,
upright,
&amp;c. (J), is carried upward in front of the right side of the body
and above the head so that the extended finger points toward the center
of the heavens, and then carried downward in front of the right breast,
forefinger still pointing upright." (<i>Dakota</i> I.) "Place the extended
index, pointing upward, palm to the left, as high as and before the top
of the head; push the hand up and down a slight distance several times,
the eyes being directed upward at the time." (<i>Hidatsa</i> I;
<i>Kaiowa</i> I;
<i>Arikara</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i> II; <i>Wichita</i>
II.)</p>

<p>Time past is not only expressed, but some tribes give a distinct
modification
to show a short or long time past. The following are examples:</p>

<p><i>Lately, recently</i>.&mdash;Hold the left hand at arm's length, closed, with
forefinger
only extended and pointing in the direction of the place where
the event occurred; then hold the right hand against the right shoulder,
closed, but with index extended and pointing in the direction of the left.
The hands may be exchanged, the right extended and the left retained,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>[pg 367]</span>
as the case may require for ease in description. (<i>Absaroka I; Shoshoni
and Banak</i> I.)</p>

<p><i>Long ago</i>.&mdash;Both hands closed, forefingers extended and straight;
pass
one hand slowly at arm's length, pointing horizontally, the other against
the shoulder or near it, pointing in the same direction as the opposite
one. Frequently the tips of the forefingers are placed together, and the
hands drawn apart, until they reach the positions described.
(<i>Absaroka</i> I; <i>Shoshoni and Banak</i> I.)</p>

<p>The Comanche, Wichita, and other Indians designate a <i>short time
ago</i> by placing the tips of the forefinger and thumb of the left hand
together, the remaining fingers closed, and holding the hand before the
body with forefinger and thumb pointing toward the right shoulder; the
index and thumb of the right hand are then similarly held and placed
against those of the left, when the hands are slowly drawn apart a short
distance. For a <i>long time ago</i> the hands are similarly held, but
drawn
farther apart. Either of these signs may be and frequently is preceded
by those for <i>day, month</i>, or <i>year</i>, when it is desired to
convey a definite
idea of the time past.</p>

<p>A sign is reported with the abstract idea of <i>future</i>, as follows:
"The
arms are flexed and hands brought together in front of the body as in
type-position (W). The hands are made to move in wave-like motions
up and down together and from side to side." (<i>Oto</i> I.) The authority
gives the poetical conception of "Floating on the tide of time."</p>

<p>The ordinary mode of expressing future time is, however, by some
figurative reference, as the following: Count off fingers, then shut all
the fingers of both hands several times, and touch the hair and tent or
other white object. (<i>Apache</i> III.) "Many years; when I am old
(whitehaired)."</p>


<h4>CONJUNCTIONS.</h4>

<p>An interesting instance where the rapid connection of signs has the
effect of the conjunction <i>and</i> is shown in <span class="sc">N&#225;tci's Narrative</span>,
<i>infra</i>.</p>


<h4>PREPOSITIONS.</h4>

<p>In the <span class="sc">Tendoy-Huerito Dialogue</span> (page <a href="#page489">489</a>) the combination of
gestures supplies the want of the proposition <i>to</i>.</p>


<h4>PUNCTUATION.</h4>

<p>While this is generally accompanied by facial expression, manner of
action, or pause, instances have been noticed suggesting the device of
interrogation points and periods.</p>

<h5><i>Mark of interrogation.</i></h5>

<p>The Shoshoni, Absaroka, Dakota, Comanche, and other Indians, when
desiring to ask a question, precede the gestures constituting the
information
desired by a sign intended to attract attention and "asking for,"
viz., by holding the flat right hand, with the palm down, directed, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>[pg 368]</span>
individual interrogated, with or without lateral oscillating motion; the
gestural sentence, when completed, being closed by the same sign and
a look of inquiry. This recalls the Spanish use of the interrogation
points before and after the question.</p>

<h5><i>Period</i>.</h5>

<p>A Hidatsa, after concluding a short statement, indicated its conclusion
by placing the inner edges of the clinched hands together before the
breast, and passing them outward and downward to their respective
sides in an emphatic manner, Fig. 334, page <a href="#page528">528</a>. This sign is also used
in other connections to express <i>done</i>.</p>

<p>The same mode of indicating the close of a narrative or statement is
made by the Wichitas, by holding the extended left hand horizontally
before the body, fingers pointing to the right, palm either toward the
body or downward, and cutting edgewise downward past the tips of the
left with the extended right hand. This is the same sign given in the
<span class="sc">Address of Kin Ch&#275;-&#277;ss</span> as <i>cut off</i>, and is illustrated in Fig. 324,
page
<a href="#page522">522</a>. This is more ideographic and convenient than the device of the
Abyssinian Galla, reported by M.A. d'Abbadie, who denoted a comma
by a slight stroke of a leather whip, a semicolon by a harder one, and
a full stop by one still harder.</p>



<h3><i>GESTURES AIDING ARCH&#198;OLOGIC RESEARCH.</i></h3>

<p>The most interesting light in which the Indians of North America
can be regarded is in their present representation of a stage of evolution
once passed through by our own ancestors. Their signs, as well as
their myths and customs, form a part of the paleontology of humanity to
be studied in the history of the latter as the geologist, with similar
object,
studies all the strata of the physical world. At this time it is only
possible to suggest the application of gesture signs to elucidate
pictographs,
and also their examination to discover religious, sociologic, and
historic ideas preserved in them, as has been done with great success in
the radicals of oral speech.</p>


<h4>SIGNS CONNECTED WITH PICTOGRAPHS.</h4>

<p>The picture writing of Indians is the sole form in which they recorded
events and ideas that can ever be interpreted without the aid of a
traditional
key, such as is required for the signification of the wampum
belts of the Northeastern tribes and the <i>quippus</i> of Peru. Strips of
bark, tablets of wood, dressed skins of animals, and the smooth surfaces
of rock have been and still are used for such records, those most
ancient, and therefore most interesting, being of course the rock etchings;
but they can only be deciphered, if at all, by the ascertained
principles on which the more modern and the more obvious are made.
Many of the numerous and widespread rock carvings are mere idle
sketches&mdash;of natural objects, mainly animals, and others are as
exclusively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>[pg 369]</span>
mnemonic as the wampum above mentioned. Even since the
Columbian discovery some tribes have employed devices yet ruder than
the rudest pictorial attempt as markers for the memory. An account
of one of these is given in E. Winslow's Relation (A.D. 1624), <i>Col.
Mass.
Hist. Soc.</i>, 2d series, ix, 1822, p. 99, as follows:</p>

<p>"Instead of records and chronicles they take this course: Where any
remarkable act is done, in memory of it, either in the place or by some
pathway near adjoining, they make a round hole in the ground about a
foot deep, and as much over, which, when others passing by behold,
they inquire the cause and occasion of the same, which being once
known, they are careful to acquaint all men as occasion serveth therewith.
And lest such holes should be filled or grown over by any accident,
as men pass by they will often renew the same; by which means
many things of great antiquity are fresh in memory. So that as a man
traveleth, if he can understand his guide, his journey will be the less
tedious, by reason of the many historical discourses which will be related
unto him."</p>

<p>Gregg, in <i>Commerce of the Prairies</i>, <i>New York</i>, 1844, II, 286, says of
the
Plains tribes: "When traveling, they will also pile heaps of stones upon
mounds or conspicuous points, so arranged as to be understood by their
passing comrades; and sometimes they set up the bleached buffalo
heads, which are everywhere scattered over those plains, to indicate the
direction of their march, and many other facts which may be communicated
by those simple signs."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:53%;"><a href="images/fig151.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig151.png" alt="&quot;I am going to the east.&quot; Abnaki" /></a>Fig. 151.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width:56%;"><a href="images/fig152.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig152.png" alt="&quot;Am not gone far.&quot; Abnaki" /></a>Fig. 152.</div>

<p>A more ingenious but still arbitrary mode of giving intelligence is
practiced at this day by the Abnaki,
as reported by H.L. Masta,
chief of that tribe, now living at
Pierreville, Quebec. When they
are in the woods, to say "I am
going to the east," a stick is stuck
in the ground pointing to that
direction, Fig. 151. "Am not gone
far," another stick is stuck across
the former, close to the ground,
Fig. 152. "Gone far" is the reverse, Fig. 153. The number of days
journey of proposed absence is
shown by the same number of
sticks across the first; thus Fig.
154 signifies five days' journey.
Cutting the bark off from a tree
on one, two, three or four sides
near the butt means "Have had
poor, poorer, poorest luck."
Cutting it off all around the tree
means "I am starving." Smoking
a piece of birch bark and hanging it on a tree means "I am sick."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>[pg 370]</span>

<div class="figleft" style="width:47%;"><a href="images/fig153.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig153.png" alt="&quot;Gone far.&quot; Abnaki" /></a>Fig. 153.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width:47%;"><a href="images/fig154.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig154.png" alt="&quot;Gone five days' journey.&quot; Abnaki" /></a>Fig. 154.</div>

<p>Where there has existed any form of artistic representation, however
rude, and at the same time a system of ideographic gesture signs prevailed,
it would be expected that the form of the latter would appear in
the former. The sign of <i>river</i> and
<i>water</i> mentioned on page <a href="#page358">358</a> being
established, when it became necessary
or desirable to draw a character
or design to convey the same idea,
nothing would be more natural than
to use the graphic form of delineation
which is also above described.
It was but one more and an easy step
to fasten upon bark, skins, or rocks the evanescent air pictures that still
in pigments or carvings preserve their skeleton outline, and in their
ideography
approach, as has been shown
above, the rudiments of the phonetic
alphabets that have been constructed
by other peoples. A transition
stage between gestures and
pictographs, in which the left hand is
used as a supposed drafting surface
upon which the index draws lines,
is exhibited in the <span class="sc">Dialogue between Alaskan Indians</span>, <i>infra</i>, page
<a href="#page498">498</a>. This device is common among deaf-mutes, without equal arch&#230;ologic
importance, as it may have been suggested by the art of writing,
with which they are generally acquainted, even if not instructed in it.</p>

<p>The reproduction of apparent gesture lines in the pictographs made
by our Indians has, for obvious reasons, been most frequent in the attempt
to convey those subjective ideas which were beyond the range of
an artistic skill limited to the direct representation of objects, so that
the part of the pictographs which is still the most difficult of
interpretation
is precisely the one which the study of sign language is likely to
elucidate. The following examples of pictographs of the Indians, in
some cases compared with those from foreign sources, have been selected
because their interpretation is definitely known and the gestures
corresponding with or suggested by them are well determined.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:15%;"><a href="images/fig155.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig155.png" alt="Sun. N.A. Indian" /></a>Fig. 155.</div>

<p>The common Indian gesture sign for <i>sun</i> is: "Right hand
closed, the index and thumb curved, with tips touching, thus
approximating a circle, and held toward the
sky," the position of the fingers of the hand
forming a circle being shown in Fig. 155. Two
of the Egyptian characters for sun, Figs. 156 and 157, are plainly the
universal
conception of the disk. The latter, together with indications of
rays, Fig. 158, and in its linear form, Fig. 159, (Champollion,
<i>Dict.</i>, 9),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>[pg 371]</span>
constitutes the Egyptian character for <i>light</i>. The rays emanating
from
the whole disk appear in Figs. 160 and 161, taken from a MS. contributed
by Mr. <span class="sc">G.K. Gilbert</span> of the United States Geological
Survey, from the rock etchings
of the Moqui pueblos in Arizona. The
same authority gives from the same
locality Figs. 162 and 163 for <i>sun</i>,
which may be distinguished from several other similar etchings for
<i>star</i>
also given by him, Figs. 164, 165, 166, 167, by always showing some
indication
of a face, the latter being absent in the characters denoting <i>star</i>.</p>

<p>The Ojibwa pictograph for sun is seen
in Fig. 169, taken from Schoolcraft, <i>loc.

<p>A gesture sign for <i>sunrise, morning</i>, is: Forefinger of right hand
crooked to represent half of the sun's disk and pointed or extended to the
left, then slightly elevated.
(<i>Cheyenne</i> II.) In this connection
it may be noted that when
the gesture is carefully
made in open
country the pointing
would generally be
to the east, and the body turned so that its left would be in that
direction.
In a room in a city, or under circumstances where the points of
the compass are not specially attended to, the left side supposes
the east, and the gestures relating to sun, day, &amp;c., are
made with such reference. The half only of the disk
represented in the above gesture appears in the following
Moqui pueblo etchings for <i>morning</i> and <i>sunrise</i>,
Figs. 170, 171, and 172. (Gilbert, <i>MS.</i>)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:12%;"><a href="images/fig173.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig173.png" alt="Moon, month. Californian pictograph" /></a>Fig. 173.</div>

<p>A common gesture for <i>day</i> is when the index and thumb form a circle
(remaining fingers closed) and are passed from east to west.</p>

<p>Fig. 173 shows a pictograph found in Owen's Valley, California, a similar
one being reported in the <i>Ann. Rep. Geog. Survey west of the 100th
Meridian for 1876, Washington</i>, 1876, pl. opp. p. 326, in which the
circle
may indicate either <i>day</i> or <i>month</i> (both these gestures having
the same
execution), the course of the sun or moon being represented perhaps in
mere contradistinction to the vertical line, or perhaps the latter
signifies <i>one</i>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>[pg 372]</span>

<div class="figleft" style="width:28%;"><a href="images/fig174.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig174.png" alt="Pictograph, including sun. Coyotero Apache" /></a>Fig. 174.</div>

<p>Fig. 174 is a pictograph of the Coyotero Apaches, found at Camp
Apache, in Arizona, reported in the <i>Tenth Ann. Rep. U.S. Geolog. and
Geograph. Survey of the Territories for 1876</i>, <i>Washington</i>, 1878,
pl. lxxvii.
The sun and the ten spots of approximately the same shape represent
the days, eleven, which the
party with five pack mules
passed in traveling through
the country. The separating
lines are the nights, and may
include the conception of covering
over and consequent obscurity above referred to (page <a href="#page354">354</a>).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:12%;"><a href="images/fig177.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig177.png" alt="Moon. Ojibwa pictograph" /></a>Fig. 177.</div>

<div class="figrightno" style="width:10%;"><a href="images/fig176.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig176.png" alt="Moon. Moqui pictograph" /></a>Fig. 176.</div>

<p>A common sign for <i>moon, month</i>, is the right
hand closed, leaving the thumb and index extended,
but curved to form a half circle and the
hand held toward the sky, in a position which is
illustrated in Fig. 175, to which curve the Moqui
etching, Fig. 176, and the identical form in the
ancient Chinese has an obvious resemblance.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:15%;"><a href="images/fig179.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig179.png" alt="Sky. Egyptian character" /></a>Fig. 179.</div>

<p>The crescent, as we commonly figure the satellite,
appears also in the Ojibwa pictograph, Fig.
177 (Schoolcraft, I, pl. 58), which is the same,
with a slight addition, as the
Egyptian figurative character.</p>

<p>The sign for <i>sky</i>, also <i>heaven</i>,
is generally made by passing the index from east to west across the
zenith. This curve is apparent in the Ojibwa pictograph Fig. 178,
reported in Schoolcraft, I, pl. 18, Fig. 21, and is abbreviated
in the Egyptian character with the same
meaning, Fig. 179 (Champollion, <i>Dict.</i>, p. 1).</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:20%;"><a href="images/fig182.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig182.png" alt="Clouds. Moqui pictograph" /></a>Fig. 182.</div>

<p>A sign for <i>cloud</i> is as follows: (1) Both hands partially closed,
palms facing and near each other, brought up to
level with or slightly above, but in front of the head; (2) suddenly
separated sidewise, describing
a curve like a scallop;
this scallop motion
is repeated for "many
clouds." (<i>Cheyenne</i> II.) The same conception is in the Moqui
etchings,
Figs. 180, 181, and 182 (Gilbert <i>MS</i>.)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:15%;"><a href="images/fig183.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig183.png" alt="Clouds. Ojibwa pictograph" /></a>Fig. 183.</div>

<p>The Ojibwa pictograph for <i>cloud</i> is more elaborate, Fig. 183,
reported
in Schoolcraft, I, pl. 58. It is composed of the sign for
<i>sky</i>, to which that for <i>clouds</i> is added, the latter being
reversed
as compared with the Moqui etchings, and picturesquely
hanging from the sky.</p>

<p>The gesture sign for <i>rain</i> is described and illustrated on
page <a href="#page344">344</a>. The pictograph, Fig. 184, reported as found in New Mexico by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>[pg 373]</span>
Lieutenant Simpson (<i>Ex. Doc. No. 64, Thirty-first Congress, first
session</i>,
1850, pl. 9) is said to represent Montezuma's adjutants sounding a blast
to him for rain. The small character inside the curve
which represents the sky, corresponds with the gesturing
hand. The Moqui etching (Gilbert <i>MS.</i>) for <i>rain</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,

<p>The same authority gives
two signs for <i>lightning</i>, Figs.
186 and 187. In the latter the sky is shown, the changing
direction of the streak, and clouds with rain falling.
The part relating specially to the streak is portrayed
in a sign as follows: Right hand elevated before
and above the head, forefinger pointing upward, brought down
with great rapidity with a sinuous, undulating motion; finger still
extended diagonally downward toward the right. (<i>Cheyenne</i> II.)</p>

<p>Figs. 188 and 189 also represent <i>lightning</i>, taken by
Mr. W.H. Jackson,
photographer of the
late U.S. Geolog. and
Geog. Survey, from the
decorated walls of an estufa
in the Pueblo de
Jemez, New Mexico. The former is
blunt, for harmless, and the latter terminating
in an arrow or spear point,
for destructive or fatal, lightning.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:45%;"><a href="images/fig191.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig191.png" alt="Voice. Antelope. Cheyenne drawing" /></a>Fig. 191.</div>

<p>A common sign for <i>speech, speak</i>,
among the Indians is the repeated
motion of the index in a straight line
forward from the mouth. This line,
indicating the voice, is shown in Fig. 190, taken from the <i>Dakota
Calendar</i>, being the expression for the fact
that "the-Elk-that-hollows-walking," a Minneconjou chief, "made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>[pg 374]</span>
medicine." The ceremony is indicated by the head of an albino buffalo. A
more graphic portraiture of the conception of <i>voice</i> is in Fig. 191,
representing
an antelope and the whistling sound produced by the animal
on being surprised or alarmed. This is taken from MS. drawing book
of an Indian prisoner at Saint Augustine,
Fla., now in the Smithsonian Institution, No. 30664.</p>

<p>Fig. 192 is the exhibition of wrestling for
a turkey, the point of interest in the present
connection being the lines from the mouth
to the objects of conversation. It is taken
from the above-mentioned MS. drawing book.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/fig192.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig192.png" alt="Voice, talking. Cheyenne drawing" /></a>Fig. 192.</div>

<p>The wrestlers, according to the foot
prints, had evidently come together, when,
meeting the returning hunter, who is
wrapped in his blanket with only one
foot protruding, they separated and threw
off their blankets, leggings, and moccasins,
both endeavoring to win the turkey,
which lies between them and the donor.</p>

<p>In Fig. 193, taken from the same MS.
drawing book, the conversation is about the lassoing, shooting, and
final killing of a buffalo which has wandered to a camp. The dotted
lines indicate footprints. The Indian drawn under the buffalo having
secured the animal by the fore feet, so informs his companions, as
indicated by the line drawn from his mouth to the object mentioned; the
left-hand figure, having also secured the buffalo by the horns, gives his
nearest comrade an opportunity to strike it with an ax, which he no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page375" id="page375"></a>[pg 375]</span>
doubt announces that he will do, as the line from his mouth to the head
of the animal suggests. The Indian in the upper left-hand corner is told
by a squaw to take an arrow and join his companions, when he turns his
head to inform her that he has one already, which fact he demonstrates
by holding up the weapon.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/fig193.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig193.png" alt="Killing the buffalo. Cheyenne drawing" /></a>Fig. 193.</div>

<p>The Mexican pictograph, Fig. 194, taken from Kingsborough, II, pt.
1, p. 100, is illustrative of the sign made by the Arikara and Hidatsa for
<i>tell</i> and <i>conversation</i>. <i>Tell me</i> is: Place the flat
right hand, palm upward,
about fifteen inches in front of the right side of the face, fingers
pointing to the left and front; then draw the hand inward toward and
against the bottom of the chin. For <i>conversation</i>, talking between
two
persons, both hands are held before the breast, pointing forward, palms
up, the edges being moved several times toward one another. Perhaps,
however, the picture in fact only means the common poetical image of
"flying words."</p>

<p>Fig. 195 is one of Landa's characters, found in <i>Rel. des choses de
Yucatan</i>, p. 316, and suggests one of the gestures for <i>talk</i> and more
especially that for <i>sing</i>, in which the
extended and separated
fingers are passed forward
and slightly downward
from the mouth&mdash;"many
voices." Although the
last opinion about the
bishop is unfavorable to
the authenticity of his
work, yet even if it were
prepared by a Maya, under
his supervision, the
latter would probably
have given him some genuine
native conceptions,
and among them gestures
would be likely to occur.</p>

<p>The natural sign for
<i>hear</i>, made both by Indians
and deaf-mutes,
consisting in the motion
of the index, or the index
and thumb joined, in a
straight line to the ear, is
illustrated in the Ojibwa
pictograph Fig. 196,
"hearing ears," and those
of the same people, Figs.
197 and 198, the latter
of which is a hearing serpent, and the former means "I hear, but your
words are from a bad heart," the hands being thrown out as in the
final part of a gesture for <i>bad heart</i>, which is
made by the hand being closed and held near
the breast, with the back toward the breast,
then as the arm is suddenly extended
the hand is opened and the fingers
separated from each other.
(<i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i> I.)</p>

<p>The final part of the gesture,
representing the idea of <i>bad</i>, not connected with heart, is
illustrated in Fig. 236 on page <a href="#page411">411</a>.</p>

<p>The above Ojibwa pictographs are taken from Schoolcraft, <i>loc. cit.</i>
I, plates 58, 53, 59.</p>

<p>Fig. 199, a bas-relief taken from Dupaix's Monuments of New Spain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377"></a>[pg 377]</span>
in Kingsborough, <i>loc. cit.</i> IV, pt. 3, p. 31, has been considered to
be a
royal edict or command. The gesture <i>to hear</i> is plainly depicted, and
the
right hand is directed to the persons addressed, so the command appears
to be uttered with the preface
of <i>Hear Ye! Oyez!</i></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/fig199.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig199.png" alt="Royal edit. Maya" /></a>Fig. 199.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width:45%;"><a href="images/fig200.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig200.png" alt="To kill. Dakota" /></a>Fig. 200.</div>

<p>The typical sign for <i>kill</i>
or <i>killed</i> is: Right hand
clinched, thumb lying along
finger tips, elevated to near
the shoulder, strike downward
and outward vaguely in the direction of the object
to be killed. The abbreviated sign is simply to
clinch the right hand in the manner described and
strike it down and out from the right side. (<i>Cheyenne</i>
II.) This gesture, also appears among the Dakotas and
is illustrated in Fig. 200.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:15%;"><a href="images/fig201.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig201.png" alt="&quot;Killed arm.&quot; Dakota" /></a>Fig. 201.</div>

<p>Fig. 201, taken from the <i>Dakota Calendar</i>, illustrates this gesture.
It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>[pg 378]</span>
represents the year in which a Minneconjou chief was stabbed in the
shoulder by a Gros Ventre, and afterwards named "Dead Arm" or
"Killed Arm." At first the figure was supposed to show the permanent
drawing up of the arm by anchylosis, but that would not be likely
to be the result of the wound described, and with knowledge of the gesture
the meaning is more clear.</p>

<p>Fig. 202, taken from <i>Report upon the Reconnaissance of Northwestern
Wyoming, &amp;c., Washington</i>, 1875, p. 207, Fig. 53, found in the Wind
River Valley, Wyoming Territory, was interpreted by members of a Shoshoni
and Banak delegation to Washington in 1880 as "an Indian killed
another." The latter is very roughly delineated in the horizontal figure,
but is also represented by the line under the hand of the upright figure,
meaning the same individual. At the right is the scalp taken and the
two feathers showing the dead warrior's rank. The arm nearest the
prostrate foe shows the gesture for <i>killed</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/fig202.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig202.png" alt="Pictograph, including &quot;kill.&quot; Wyoming Ter." /></a>Fig. 202.</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width:35%;"><a href="images/fig203.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig203.png" alt="Pictograph, including &quot;kill.&quot; Wyoming Ter." /></a>Fig. 203.</div>

<p>The same gesture appears in Fig. 203, from the same authority and
locality. The scalp is here held forth, and the
numeral <i>one</i> is designated by the stroke at the bottom.</p>

<p>Fig. 204, from the same locality and authority,
was also interpreted by the Shoshoni and
Banak. It appears from their description that
a Blackfoot had attacked the habitation of
some of his own people. The right-hand upper
figure represents his horse with the lance suspended
from the side. The lower figure illustrates
the log house built against a stream.
The dots are the prints of the horse's hoofs,
while the two lines running outward from the
upper inclosure show that two thrusts of the
lance were made over the wall of the house, thus killing the occupant
and securing two bows and five arrows, as represented in the
left-hand
group. The right-hand figure of that group shows the hand raised in
the attitude of making the gesture for <i>kill</i>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>[pg 379]</span>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/fig204.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig204.png" alt="Pictograph, including &quot;kill.&quot; Wyoming Ter." /></a>Fig. 204.</div>

<p>As the Blackfeet, according to the interpreters, were the only Indians
in the locality mentioned who constructed log houses, the drawing becomes
additionally interesting, as an
attempt appears to have been made
to illustrate the crossing of the logs
at the corners, the gesture for which
(<i>log-house</i>) will be found on page <a href="#page428">428</a>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:15%;"><a href="images/fig205.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig205.png" alt="Veneration. Egyptian character" /></a>Fig. 205.</div>

<p>Fig. 205 is the Egyptian character
for <i>veneration, to glorify</i> (Champollion,
<i>Dict.</i>, 29), the author's understanding
being that the hands are raised
in surprise, astonishment.</p>

<p>The Menomoni Indians now begin
their prayers by raising their hands
in the same manner. They may have
been influenced in this respect by the
attitudes of their missionaries in
prayer and benediction. The Apaches,
who have received less civilized tuition,
in a religious gesture corresponding
with prayer spread their hands
opposite the face,
palms up and backward, apparently
expressing
the desire to
<i>receive</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:35%;"><a href="images/fig206.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig206.png" alt="Mercy. Supplication, favor. Egyptian" /></a>Fig. 206.</div>

<p>Fig. 206 is a copy
of an Egyptian tablet
reproduced from
Cooper's <i>Serpent
Myths</i>, page 28. A
priest kneels before
the great goddess
Ranno, while supplicating
her favor. The
conception of the author
is that the hands
are raised by the supplicant
to shield his
face from the glory of
the divinity. It may
be compared with
signs for asking for
<i>mercy</i> and for giving mercy to another, the former being: Extend both
forefingers, pointing upward, palms toward the breast, and hold the hands
before the chest; then draw them inward toward their respective sides,
and pass them up ward as high as the sides of the head by either cheek.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>[pg 380]</span>
(<i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i> II; <i>Wichita</i>
II.) The latter, <i>to have
mercy on another</i>, as made by the same tribes, is: Hold both hands
nearly
side by side before the chest, palms forward, forefinger only extended
and pointing upward; then move them forward
and upward, as if passing them by the
cheeks of another person from the
breast to the sides of the head.</p>

<p>A similar gesture for <i>supplication</i>
appears in Fig. 207, taken from Kingsborough,
<i>loc. cit.</i>, III, pt. I, p. 24.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:10%;"><a href="images/fig208.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig208.png" alt="Smoke. Mexican pictograph" /></a>Fig. 208.</div>

<p>An Indian gesture sign for <i>smoke</i>,
and also one for <i>fire</i>, has been described
above, page <a href="#page344">344</a>. With the former is connected the Aztec design
(Fig. 208) taken from Pipart, <i>loc. cit.</i>, II, 352, and the latter
appears
in Fig. 209, taken from Kingsborough, III, pt. I, p. 21.</p>

<p>A sign for <i>medicine-man, shaman</i>, is thus described: "With its
index-finger extended and
pointing upward, or
all the fingers extended,
back of hand outward, move
the right hand from
just in front of the
forehead, spirally
upward, nearly to
arm's length, from
left to right." (<i>Dakota</i> IV.)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:68%;"><a href="images/fig209.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig209.png" alt="Fire. Mexican pictograph" /></a>Fig. 209.</div>

<p>Fig. 210, from the
<i>Dakota Calendar</i>,
represents the making
of medicine or
conjuration. In that
case the head and
horns of a white buffalo
cow were used.</p>

<div class="figleftno" style="width:10%;"><a href="images/fig210.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig210.png" alt="&quot;Making medicine.&quot; Conjuration. Dakota" /></a>Fig. 210.</div>

<p>Fig. 211 is an Ojibwa pictograph taken from Schoolcraft, <i>loc. cit.</i>,
representing
<i>medicine-man, meda</i>. With these horns and spiral may be collated
Fig. 212 which portrays the ram-headed Egyptian god Knuphis,
or Chnum, the spirit, in
a shrine on the boat of the sun, canopied
by the serpent-goddess Ranno, who is also seen facing him inside
the shrine. This is reproduced from Cooper's <i>Serpent Myths</i>, p. 24.
The same deity is represented in Champollion, <i>Gram.</i>, p. 113, as
reproduced in Fig. 213.</p>

<p>Fig. 214 is an Ojibwa pictograph found in Schoolcraft, I, pl. 58, and given
as <i>power</i>. It corresponds with the sign for <i>doctor</i>, or
<i>medicine-man</i>,
made by the Absarokas by passing the extended and separated index
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>[pg 381]</span>
and second finger of the right hand upward from the forehead, spirally,
and is considered to indicate "superior knowledge." Among the Otos,
as part of the sign with the same meaning,
both hands are raised to the side of the head, and
the extended indices pressing the temples.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:35%;"><a href="images/fig212.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig212.png" alt="The God Knuphis. Egyptian" /></a>Fig. 212.</div>

<p>Fig. 215 is also an Ojibwa pictograph from
Schoolcraft I, pl. 59, and is said to signify <i>Meda's
power</i>. It corresponds with another sign made
for <i>medicine-man</i> by the Absarokas and Comanches,
viz, The hand passed upward before
the forehead, with index loosely extended. Combined
with the sign for <i>sky</i>, before given, page
<a href="#page372">372</a>, it means knowledge of superior matters; spiritual power.</p>

<p>The common sign for <i>trade</i> is made by extending the forefingers,
holding them obliquely upward, and crossing
them at right angles to one another, usually
in front of the chest. This is often
abbreviated by merely crossing the forefingers,
see Fig. 278, page <a href="#page452">452</a>.
It is illustrated in Fig. 216, taken
from the Prince of Wied's <i>Travels
in the Interior of North America;
London</i>, 1843, p. 352.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:15%;"><a href="images/fig215.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig215.png" alt="Meda's Power. Ojibwa pictograph" /></a>Fig. 215.</div>

<p>To this the following explanation is given: "The cross signifies, 'I
will barter or trade.' Three animals are drawn on the right hand of the
cross; one is a buffalo; the two others, a weasel (<i>Mustela
Canadensis</i>) and an otter. The writer offers in
exchange for the skins of these animals (probably
meaning that of a white buffalo) the articles
which he has drawn on the left side of the cross.
He has, in the first place, depicted a beaver very plainly, behind which
there is a gun; to the left of the beaver are thirty strokes, each ten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>[pg 382]</span>
separated by a longer line; this means, I will give thirty beaver skins
and a gun for the skins of the three animals on the right hand of the
cross."</p>

<p>Fig. 217 is from Kingsborough, III, pt. 1, p. 25,
and illustrates the sign for to <i>give</i> or <i>to present</i>,
made by the Brul&#233;-Dakotas by holding both hands
edgewise before the breast, pointing forward and
upward, the right above the left, then throwing
them quickly downward until the forearms
reach a horizontal position.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:80%;"><a href="images/fig217.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig217.png" alt="Offering. Mexican pictograph" /></a>Fig. 217.</div>

<p>Fig. 218 is taken from the <i>Dakota Calendar</i>,
representing a successful raid of the
Absarokas or Crows upon the Brul&#233;-Sioux, in which the village of
the latter was surprised and a large number of horses captured. That
capture is exhibited by the horse-tracks
moving from the <i>village</i>, the gesture
sign for which is often made by a circle
formed either by the opposed thumbs and
forefingers of both hands or by a circular motion
of both hands, palms inward, toward each other. In
some cases there is a motion of
the circle, from above downward, as formed.</p>

<p>Fig. 219, from Kingsborough I, pt. 3, p. 10, represents <i>Chapultepec</i>,
"Mountain of the Locust," by one enormous locust on top of
a hill. This shows the mode of augmentation in the same
manner as is often done by an exaggerated gesture. The
curves at the base of the mountain are intelligible only as
being formed in the sign for <i>many</i>, described on pages <a href="#page359">359</a>
and <a href="#page488">488</a>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:20%;"><a href="images/fig219.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig219.png" alt="Chapultepec. Mexican pictograph" /></a>Fig. 219.</div>

<p>Fig. 220, taken from Pipart, <i>loc. cit.</i>, is the Mexican pictograph
for <i>soil
cultivated</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, tilled and planted. Fig. 221, from the same
authority,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>[pg 383]</span>
shows the sprouts coming from the cultivated soil, and may be compared with
the signs for <i>grass</i> and <i>grow</i> on page <a href="#page343">343</a>.</p>

<div class="figleftno" style="width:15%;"><a href="images/fig220.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig220.png" alt="Soil. Mexican pictograph" /></a>Fig. 220.</div>

<p>The gesture sign for <i>road, path</i>, is sometimes made by indicating two
lines forward from the body, then imitating
walking with the hands upon the imaginary
road. The same natural representation of
road is seen in Fig. 222, taken from Pipart,
<i>loc. cit.</i>, page 352. A place where two roads
meet&mdash;cross-roads&mdash;is shown in Fig. 223, from Kingsborough.
Two persons are evidently having a chat in sign language
at the cross-roads.</p>

<p>If no gesture is actually included in all of
the foregoing pictographs, it is seen that a
gesture sign is made with the same conception
which is obvious in the ideographic pictures. They are selected as
specially transparent and clear. Many others less distinct
are now the subject of examination for elucidation. The following examples
are added to show the ideographic style of
pictographs not connected with gestures,
lest it may be suspected that an attempt
is made to prove that gestures are always
included in or connected with them.
Fig. 224, from the <i>Dakota Calendar</i>,
refers to the small-pox which broke out in the
year (1802) which it specifies. Fig. 225 shows in the design at the
left, a warning or notice, that though a goat can climb up the rocky
trail a horse will tumble&mdash;"No Thoroughfare." This was contributed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page384" id="page384"></a>[pg 384]</span>
by Mr. J.K. Hillers, photographer of the United States Geological Survey,
as observed by him in Ca&#241;on De Chelly, New Mexico, in 1880.</p>

<h4>SIGNS CONNECTED WITH ETHNOLOGIC FACTS.</h4>

<p>The present limits permit only a few examples of the manner in
which the signs of Indians refer to sociologic, religious, historic, and
other ethnologic facts. They may incite research to elicit further
information
of the same character.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:15%;"><a href="images/fig226.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig226.png" alt="Raising of war party. Dakota" /></a>Fig. 226.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/fig227.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig227.png" alt="&quot;Led four war parties.&quot; Dakota drawing" /></a>Fig. 227.</div>

<p>The Prince of Wied gives in his list of signs the heading <i>Partisan</i>,
a term of the Canadian voyageurs, signifying a leader of an occasional
or volunteer war party, the sign being reported
as follows: Make first the sign of
the pipe, afterwards open the thumb and
index-finger of the right hand, back of the
hand outward, and move it forward and upward
in a curve. This is explained by
the author's account in a different connection,
that to become recognized as a leader
of such a war party as above mentioned,
the first act among the tribes
using the sign was the consecration, by fasting succeeded
by feasting, of a medicine pipe without ornament, which the
leader of the expedition afterward bore before him as his
badge of authority, and it therefore naturally became an emblematic
sign. This sign with its interpretation supplies a meaning to Fig. 226
from the <i>Dakota Calendar</i> showing "One Feather," a Sioux chief who
raised in that year a large war party against the Crows, which fact is
simply denoted by his holding out demonstratively an unornamented
pipe. In connection with this subject, Fig. 227, drawn and explained
by Two Strike, an Ogalala Dakota, relating to his own achievements,
displays four plain pipes to exhibit the fact that he had led four war
parties.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:11%;"><a href="images/fig228.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig228.png" alt="Sociality. Friendship. Ojibwa pictograph" /></a>Fig. 228.</div>

<p>The sign of the pipe or of smoking is made in a different manner, when
used to mean <i>friend</i>, as follows: (1) Tips of the two first fingers
of the
right hand placed against or at right angles to the mouth; (2) suddenly
elevated upward and outward to imitate smoke expelled.
(<i>Cheyenne</i> II). "We two smoke together." This is illustrated
in the Ojibwa pictograph, Fig. 228, taken
from Schoolcraft I, pl. 59.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:25%;"><a href="images/fig230.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig230.png" alt="Peace. Friendship with whites. Dakota" /></a>Fig. 230.</div>

<div class="figrightno" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/fig229.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig229.png" alt="Peace. Friendship. Dakota" /></a>Fig. 229.</div>

<p>A ceremonial sign for <i>peace, friendship</i>,
is the extended fingers, separated (R), interlocked in front of the breast,
hands horizontal, backs outward. (<i>Dakota</i> I.) Fig. 229 from the
<i>Dakota
Calendar</i> exhibits the beginning of this gesture. When the idea conveyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page385" id="page385"></a>[pg 385]</span>
is peace or friendship with the whites, the hand shaking of the latter is
adopted as in Fig. 230, also taken from the <i>Dakota Calendar</i>, and
referring
to the peace made in 1855 by General Harney, at Fort
Pierre, with a number of the tribes of the Dakotas.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that while the ceremonial gesture of
uniting or linking hands is common and ancient in
token of peace, the practice of shaking hands on
meeting, now the annoying etiquette of the Indians in their intercourse
with whites, was not until very recently and is even now seldom
used by them between each other, and is clearly a foreign importation.
Their fancy for affectionate greeting was in giving a pleasant bodily,
sensation by rubbing each other on the breast, abdomen, and limbs, or
by a hug. The senseless and inconvenient custom of shaking hands is,
indeed, by no means general throughout the world, and in the extent to
which it prevails in the United States is a subject of ridicule by
foreigners.
The Chinese, with a higher conception of politeness, shake their
own hands. The account of a recent observer of the meeting of two
polite Celestials is: "Each placed the fingers of one hand over the fist
of the other, so that the thumbs met, and then standing a few feet apart
raised his hands gently up and down in front of his breast. For special
courtesy, after the foregoing gesture, they place the hand which had been
the actor in it on the stomach of its owner, not on that part of the
interlocutor,
the whole proceeding being subjective, but perhaps a relic of
objective performance." In Miss Bird's <i>Unbeaten Trades in Japan,
London</i>,
1880, the following is given as the salutatory etiquette of that
empire: "As acquaintances come in sight of each other they slacken their
pace and approach with downcast eyes and averted faces as if neither
were worthy of beholding each other; then they bow low, so low as to
bring the face, still kept carefully averted, on a level with the knees, on
which the palms of the hands are pressed. Afterwards, during the
friendly strife of each to give the <i>pas</i> to the other, the palms of
the hands
are diligently rubbed against each other."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:45%;"><a href="images/fig231.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig231.png" alt="Friendship. Australian" /></a>Fig. 231.</div>

<p>The interlocking of the fingers of both hands above given as an Indian
sign (other instances being mentioned
under the head of <span class="sc">Signals</span>, <i>infra</i>) is
also reported by R. Brough Smyth, <i>Aborigines
of Victoria</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, Vol. II, p.
308, as made by the natives of Cooper's
Creek, Australia, to express the highest degree of friendship, including
a special form of hospitality in which the wives of the entertainer
performed
a part. Fig. 231 is reproduced from a cut in the work referred to.</p>

<p>But besides this interlocked form of signifying the union of friendship
the hands are frequently grasped together. Sometimes the sign is
abbreviated
by simply extending the hand as if about to grasp that of
another, and sometimes the two forefingers are laid side by side, which
last sign also means, <i>same, brother</i> and <i>companion</i>. For
description and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>[pg 386]</span>
illustration of these three signs, see respectively pages <a href="#page521">521</a>, <a href="#page527">527</a>, and <a href="#page317">317</a>.
A different execution of the same conception of union or linking to signify
<i>friend</i> is often made as follows: Hook the curved index over the
curved
forefinger of the left hand, the palm of the latter pointing forward, the
palm of the right hand being turned toward the face; remaining fingers
and thumbs being closed. (<i>Dakota</i> VIII.) Fig. 232.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/fig232.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig232.png" alt="Friend. Brule Dakota" /></a>Fig. 232.</div>

<p>Wied's sign for medicine is "Stir with the right
hand into the left, and afterward blow into the
latter." All persons familiar with the Indians
will understand that the term "medicine," foolishly
enough adopted by both French and English
to express the aboriginal magic arts, has no therapeutic
significance. Very few even pretended
remedies were administered to the natives and
probably never by the professional shaman, who worked by incantation,
often pulverizing and mixing the substances mystically used, to prevent
their detection. The same mixtures were employed in divination. The
author particularly mentions Mandan ceremonies, in which a white "medicine"
stone, as hard as pyrites, was produced by rubbing in the hand
snow or the white feathers of a bird. The blowing away of the disease,
considered to be introduced by a supernatural power foreign to the
body, was a common part of the juggling performance.</p>

<p>A sign for <i>stone</i> is as follows: With the back of the arched right
hand
(H) strike repeatedly in the palm of the left, held horizontal, back
outward,
at the height of the breast and about a foot in front; the ends of
the fingers point in opposite directions. (<i>Dakota</i> I.) From its use
when
the stone was the only hammer.</p>

<p>A suggestive sign for <i>knife</i> is reported, viz: Cut past the mouth
with
the raised right hand. (<i>Wied.</i>) This probably refers to the general
practice
of cutting off food, as much being crammed into the mouth as can
be managed and then separated from the remaining mass by a stroke
of a knife. This is specially the usage with fat and entrails, the Indian
delicacies.</p>

<p>An old sign for <i>tomahawk, ax</i>, is as follows: Cross the arms and
slide the edge of the right hand, held vertically, down over the left
arm. (<i>Wied.</i>) This is still employed, at least for a small hatchet,
or
"dress tomahawk," and would be unintelligible without special knowledge.
The essential point is laying the extended right hand in the
bend of the left elbow. The sliding down over the left arm is an almost
unavoidable but quite unnecessary accompaniment to the sign, which
indicates the way in which the hatchet is usually carried. Pipes, whips,
bows and arrows, fans, and other dress or emblematic articles of the
"buck" are seldom or never carried in the bend of the left elbow as is
the ax. The pipe is usually held in the left hand.</p>

<p>The following sign for <i>Indian village</i> is given by Wied: Place the
open thumb and forefinger of each hand opposite to each other, as if to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>[pg 387]</span>
make a circle, but leaving between them a small interval; afterward move
them from above downward simultaneously. The villages of the tribes
with which the author was longest resident, particularly the Mandans
and Arikaras, were surrounded by a strong circular stockade, spaces or
breaks in the circle being left for entrance or exit.</p>

<p>Signs for <i>dog</i> are made by some of the tribes of the plains
essentially
the same as the following: Extend and spread the right, fore, and middle
fingers, and draw the hand about eighteen inches from left to right across
the front of the body at the height of the navel, palm downward, fingers
pointing toward the left and a little downward, little and ring fingers to
be
loosely closed, the thumb against the ring-finger. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.) The
sign
would not be intelligible without knowledge of the fact that before the
introduction of the horse, and even yet, the dog has been used to draw
the tent- or lodge-poles in moving camp, and the sign represents the
trail. Indians less nomadic, who built more substantial lodges, and to
whom the material for poles was less precious than on the plains, would
not have comprehended this sign without such explanation as is equivalent
to a translation from a foreign language, and the more general one
is the palm lowered as if to stroke gently in a line conforming to the
animal's
head and neck. It is abbreviated by simply lowering the hand
to the usual height of the wolfish aboriginal breed, and suggests
<i>the</i> animal
<i>par excellence</i> domesticated by the Indians and made a companion.</p>

<p>Several examples connected with this heading may be noticed under
the preceding head of gestures connected with pictographs, and others
of historic interest will be found among the <span class="sc">Tribal Signs</span>, <i>infra</i>.</p>




<h2>NOTABLE POINTS FOR FURTHER RESEARCHES.</h2>


<p>It is considered desirable to indicate some points to which for special
reasons the attention of collaborators for the future publication on the
general subject of sign language may be invited. These now follow:</p>



<h3><i>INVENTION OF NEW SIGNS.</i></h3>

<p>It is probable that signs will often be invented by individual Indians
who may be pressed for them by collectors to express certain ideas,
which signs of course form no part of any current language; but while
that fact should, if possible, be ascertained and reported, the signs so
invented are not valueless merely because they are original and not
traditional, if they are made in good faith and in accordance with the
principles of sign formation. Less error will arise in this direction than
from the misinterpretation of the idea intended to be conveyed by
spontaneous
signs. The process resembles the coining of new words to which
the higher languages owe their copiousness. It is observed in the signs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>[pg 388]</span>
invented by Indians for each new product of civilization brought to
their notice.</p>

<p>An interesting instance is in the sign for <i>steamboat</i>, made at the
request
of the writer by White Man (who, however, did not like that sobriquet
and announced his intention to change his name to Lean Bear), an
Apache, in June, 1880, who had a few days before seen a steamboat for
the first time. After thinking a moment he gave an original sign, described
as follows:</p>

<p>Make the sign for <i>water</i>, by placing the flat right hand before the
face,
pointing upward and forward, the back forward, with the wrist as high
as the nose; then draw it down and inward toward the chin; then with
both hands indicate the outlines of a horizontal oval figure from before
the body back to near the chest (being the outline of the deck); then
place both flat hands, pointing forward, thumbs higher than the outer
edges, and push them forward to arms'-length (illustrating the powerful
forward motion of the vessel).</p>

<p>An original sign for <i>telegraph</i> is given in <span class="sc">Natci's Narrative</span>,
<i>infra</i>.</p>

<p>An Indian skilled in signs, as also a deaf-mute, at the sight of a new
object, or at the first experience of some new feeling or mental relation,
will devise some mode of expressing it in pantomimic gesture or by a
combination
of previously understood signs, which will be intelligible to
others, similarly skilled, provided that they have seen the same objects
or have felt the same emotions. But if a number of such Indians or
deaf-mutes were to see an object&mdash;for instance an elephant&mdash;for the first
time, each would perhaps hit upon a different sign, in accordance with
the characteristic appearance most striking to him. That animal's trunk
is generally the most attractive lineament to deaf-mutes, who make a
sign by pointing to the nose and moving the arm as the trunk is moved.
Others regard the long tusks as the most significant feature, while others
are struck by the large head and small eyes. This diversity of conception
brings to mind the poem of "The Blind Men and the Elephant," which
with true philosophy in an amusing guise explains how the sense of touch
led the "six men of Indostan" severally to liken the animal to a wall,
spear, snake, tree, fan, and rope. A consideration of invented or original
signs, as showing the operation of the mind of an Indian or other
uncivilized
gesturer, has a psychologic interest, and as connected with the
vocal expression, often also invented at the same time, has further value.</p>



<h3><i>DANGER OF SYMBOLIC INTERPRETATION.</i></h3>

<p>In the examination of sign language it is important to form a clear
distinction between signs proper and symbols. The terms signs and
symbols are often used interchangeably, but with liability to
misconstruction,
as many persons, whether with right or wrong lexical definition,
ascribe to symbols an occult and mystic signification. All characters
in Indian picture-writing have been loosely styled symbols, and, as
there is no logical distinction, between the characters impressed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>[pg 389]</span>
enduring form and when merely outlined in the ambient air, all Indian
gestures, motions, and attitudes might with equal appropriateness be
called symbolic. While, however, all symbols come under the generic
head of signs, very few signs are in accurate classification symbols. S.T.
Coleridge has defined a symbol to be a sign included in the idea it
represents. This may be intelligible if it is intended that an ordinary
sign is extraneous to the concept and, rather than suggested by it, is
invented to express it by some representation or analogy, while a symbol
may be evolved by a process of thought from the concept itself; but it is
no very exhaustive or practically useful distinction. Symbols are less
obvious and more artificial than mere signs, require convention, are not
only abstract, but metaphysical, and often need explanation from history,
religion, and customs. They do not depict but suggest subjects; do not
speak directly through the eye to the intelligence, but presuppose in the
mind knowledge of an event or fact which the sign recalls. The symbols
of the ark, dove, olive branch, and rainbow would be wholly meaningless
to people unfamiliar with the Mosaic or some similar cosmology, as
would be the cross and the crescent to those ignorant of history. The
last named objects appeared in the class of <i>emblems</i> when used in
designating
the conflicting powers of Christendom and Islamism. Emblems
do not necessarily require any analogy between the objects representing,
and the objects or qualities represented, but may arise from pure accident.
After a scurrilous jest the beggar's wallet became the emblem of the
confederated
nobles, the Gueux of the Netherlands; and a sling, in the early
minority of Louis XIV, was adopted from the refrain of a song by the
Frondeur opponents of Mazarin. The portraiture of a fish, used, especially
by the early Christians, for the name and title of Jesus Christ was
still more accidental, being, in the Greek word &iota;&chi;&theta;&upsilon;&sigmaf;,
an acrostic composed
of the initials of the several Greek words signifying that name and title.
This origin being unknown to persons whose religious enthusiasm was
as usual in direct proportion to their ignorance, they expended much
rhetoric to prove that there was some true symbolic relation between an
actual fish and the Saviour of men. Apart from this misapplication, the
fish undoubtedly became an emblem of Christ and of Christianity, appearing
frequently on the Roman catacombs and at one time it was used
hermeneutically.</p>

<p>The several tribal signs for the Sioux, Arapahos, Cheyennes, &amp;c., are
their emblems precisely as the star-spangled flag is that of the United
States, but there is nothing symbolic in any of them. So the signs for
individual chiefs, when not merely translations of their names, are
emblematic
of their family totems or personal distinctions, and are no more
symbols than are the distinctive shoulder-straps of army officers. The
<i>crux ansata</i> and the circle formed by a snake biting its tail are
symbols,
but <i>consensus</i> as well as invention was necessary for their
establishment,
and the Indians have produced nothing so esoteric, nothing which they
intended for hermeneutic as distinct from descriptive or mnemonic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id="page390"></a>[pg 390]</span>
purposes. Sign language can undoubtedly be and is employed to express
highly metaphysical ideas, but to do that in a symbolic system requires
a development of the mode of expression consequent upon a similar
development
of the mental idiocrasy of the gesturers far beyond any yet
found among historic tribes north of Mexico. A very few of their signs
may at first appear to be symbolic, yet even those on closer examination
will probably be relegated to the class of emblems.</p>

<p>The point urged is that while many signs can be used as emblems and
both can be converted by convention into symbols or be explained as
such by perverted ingenuity, it is futile to seek for that form of
psychologic
exuberance in the stage of development attained by the tribes now
under consideration. All predetermination to interpret either their
signs or their pictographs on the principles of symbolism as understood
or pretended to be understood by its admirers, and as are sometimes
properly applied to Egyptian hieroglyphs, results in mooning mysticism.
This was shown by a correspondent who enthusiastically lauded the
<i>Dakota Calendar</i> (edited by the present writer, and which is a mere
figuration
of successive occurrences in the history of the people), as a numerical
exposition of the great doctrines of the Sun religion in the equations
of time, and proved to his own satisfaction that our Indians preserved
hermeneutically the lost geometric cultus of pre-Cushite scientists.</p>

<p>Another exhibition of this vicious practice was recently made in the
interpretation of an inscribed stone alleged to have been unearthed near
Zanesville, Ohio. Two of the characters were supposed, in liberal exercise
of the imagination, to represent the <i>&Alpha;</i> and <i>&Omega;</i>
of the Greek alphabet.
At the comparatively late date when the arbitrary arrangement
of the letters of that alphabet had become fixed, the initial and
concluding
letters might readily have been used to represent respectively
the beginning and the end of any series or number of things, and this
figure of speech was employed in the book of Revelations. In the attempted
interpretation of the inscription mentioned, which was hawked
about to many scientific bodies, and published over the whole country,
the supposed alpha and omega were assumed to constitute a universal
as well as sacred symbol for the everlasting Creator. The usual <i>menu</i>
of Roman feasts, commencing with eggs and ending with apples, was
also commonly known at the time when the book of Revelations was
written, and the phrase "<i>ab ovo usque ad mala</i>" was as appropriate as
"from alpha to omega" to express "from the beginning to the end."
In deciphering the stone it would, therefore, be as correct in principle
to take one of its oval and one of its round figures, call them egg and
apple, and make them the symbols of eternity. In fact, not depending
wholly for significance upon the order of courses of a feast or the
accident
of alphabetical position, but having intrinsic characteristics in reference
to the origin and fruition of life, the egg and apple translation,
would be more acceptable to the general judgment, and it is recommended
to enthusiasts who insist on finding symbols where none exist.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>[pg 391]</span>



<h3><i>SIGNS USED BY WOMEN AND CHILDREN.</i></h3>

<p>For reasons before given it is important to ascertain the varying extent
of familiarity with sign language among the members of the several
tribes, how large a proportion possesses any skill in it, and the average
amount of their vocabulary. It is also of special interest to learn the
degree
to which women become proficient, and the age at which children
commence its practice; also whether they receive systematic instruction
in it. The statement was made by Titchkem&#225;tski that the Kaiowa and
Comanche women know nothing of sign language, while the Cheyenne
women are versed in it. As he is a Cheyenne, however, he may not
have a large circle of feminine acquaintances beyond his own tribe,
and his negative testimony is not valuable. Rev. A.J. Holt, from
large experience, asserts that the Kaiowa and Comanche women do
know and practice sign language, though the Cheyenne either are more
familiar with it than the Kaiowa or have a greater degree of expertness.
The Comanche women, he says, are the peers of any sign-talkers.
Colonel Dodge makes the broad assertion that even among the Plains
tribes only the old, or at least middle-aged, men use signs properly,
and that he has not seen any women or even young men who were at
all reliable in signs. He gives this statement to show the difficulty in
acquiring sign language; but it is questionable if the fact is not simply
the result of the rapid disuse of signs, in many tribes, by which, cause
women, not so frequently called upon to employ them, and the younger
generation, who have had no necessity to learn them, do not become
expert. Disappearing Mist, as before mentioned, remembers a time
when the Iroquois women and children used signs more than the men.</p>

<p>It is also asserted, with some evidence, that the signs used by males
and females are different, though mutually understood, and some minor
points for observation may be indicated, such as whether the commencement
of counting upon the fingers is upon those of the right or the left
hand, and whether Indians take pains to look toward the south when
suggesting the course of the sun, which would give the motion from
left to right.</p>

<hr />

<p>A suggestion has been made by a correspondent that some secret
signs of affiliation are known and used by the members of the several
associations, religious and totemic, which have been often noticed among
several Indian tribes. No evidence of this has been received, but the
point is worth attention.</p>



<h3><i>POSITIVE SIGNS RENDERED NEGATIVE.</i></h3>

<p>In many cases positive signs to convey some particular idea are not
reported, and in their place a sign with the opposite signification is
given,
coupled with the sign of negation. In other words, the only mode of
expressing the intended meaning is supposed to be by negation of the
reverse of what it is desired to describe. In this manner "fool&mdash;no,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392"></a>[pg 392]</span>
would be "wise," and "good&mdash;no," would be "bad." This mode of expression
is very frequent as a matter of option when the positive signs are in
fact also used. The reported absence of positive signs for the ideas
negatived
is therefore often made with as little propriety as if when an ordinary
speaker chose to use the negative form "not good," it should be
inferred that he was ignorant of the word "bad." It will seldom prove,
on proper investigation, that where sign language has reached and retained
any high degree of development it will show such poverty as to
require the expedient of negation of an affirmative to express an idea
which is intrinsically positive.</p>



<h3><i>DETAILS OF POSITIONS OF FINGERS.</i></h3>

<p>The signs of the Indians appear to consist of motions more often than
of positions&mdash;a fact enhancing the difficulty both of their description
and illustration&mdash;and the motions when not designedly abbreviated are
generally large, free, and striking, seldom minute. It seems also to be
the general rule among Indians as among deaf-mutes that the point of
the finger is used to trace outlines and the palm of the hand to describe
surfaces. From an examination of the identical signs made to each
other for the same object by Indians of the same tribe and band, they
appear to make many gestures with little regard to the position of the
fingers and to vary in such arrangement from individual taste. Some
of the elaborate descriptions, giving with great detail the attitude of the
fingers of any particular gesturer and the inches traced by his motions,
are of as little necessity as would be, when quoting a written word, a
careful reproduction of the flourishes of tailed letters and the thickness
of down-strokes in individual chirography. The fingers must be in
<i>some</i>
position, but that is frequently accidental, not contributing to the
general
and essential effect. An example may be given in the sign for <i>white
man</i> which Medicine Bull, <i>infra</i>, page <a href="#page491">491</a>, made by drawing the
palmar
surface of the extended index across the forehead, and in <span class="sc">Lean Wolf's
Complaint</span>, <i>infra</i>, page <a href="#page526">526</a>, the same motion is made by the back of
the thumb pressed upon the middle joint of the index, fist closed. The
execution
as well as the conception in both cases was the indication of the line of
the hat on the forehead, and the position of the fingers in forming the
line is altogether immaterial. There is often also a custom or "fashion" in
which not only different tribes, but different persons in the same tribe,
gesture the same sign with different degrees of beauty, for there is
calligraphy in sign language, though no recognized orthography. It is
nevertheless better to describe and illustrate with unnecessary minuteness
than to fail in reporting a real distinction. There are, also, in
fact, many signs formed by mere positions of the fingers, some of which
are abbreviations, but in others the arrangement of the fingers in itself
forms a picture. An instance of the latter is one of the signs given for
the <i>bear</i>, viz.: Middle and third finger of right hand clasped down
by the thumb, fore and little finger extended crooked downward. See
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>[pg 393]</span>
<span class="sc">Extracts from Dictionary</span>, <i>infra</i>. This reproduction, of the animals
peculiar claws, with the hand and in any position relative to the body,
would
suffice without the pantomime of scratching in the air, which is added
only if the sign without it should not be at once comprehended.</p>



<h3><i>MOTIONS RELATIVE TO PARTS OF THE BODY.</i></h3>


<div class="figright" style="width:60%;"><a href="images/fig233.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig233.png" alt="Lie, Falsehood. Arikara" /></a>Fig. 233.</div>

<p>The specified relation of the positions and motions of the hands to
different parts of the body is essential to the formation and description
of many signs. Those for <i>speak</i>, <i>hear</i>, and <i>see</i>, which
must be respectively
made relative to the mouth, ear and eye, are manifest examples;
and there are others less obviously dependent upon parts of the body,
such as the heart or head, which would not be intelligible without
apposition.
There are also some directly connected with height from the
ground and other points of reference. In, however, a large proportion
of the signs noted the position of the hands with reference to the body
can be varied or disregarded. The hands making the motions can be
held high or low, as the gesturer is standing or sitting, or the person
addressed is distant or near by. These variations have been partly
discussed
under the head of abbreviations. While descriptions made with
great particularity are cumbrous, it is desirable to give the full detail
of that gesture which most clearly carries out the generic conception,
with, if possible, also the description of such deviations
and abbreviations as are most confusing. For instance, it is
well to explain that signs for yes and no, described with precise
detail as in <span class="sc">Extracts from Dictionary</span>, <i>infra</i>, are
also often made by an Indian when wrapped in his blanket
with only a forefinger protruding, the former by a mere downward
and the latter by a simple outward bend of that
finger. An example may be also taken from the following
sign for <i>lie, falsehood</i>, made by an Ankara, Fig. 233. in which
the separated index and second fingers are moved sidewise in a downward
line near but below the mouth, which may be compared with other executions
of the motion with the same position of the fingers directly
forward from the mouth, and with that given in <span class="sc">Lean Wolf's Complaint</span>,
illustrated on page <a href="#page528">528</a>, in which the motion is made carelessly
across the body. The original sign was undoubtedly made directly
from the mouth, the conception being "two tongues," two accounts or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>[pg 394]</span>
opposed statements, one of which must be false, but the finger-position
coming to be established for two tongues has relation to the original
conception
whether or not made near or in reference to the mouth, the latter
being understood.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that sometimes the position of the fingers is material
as forming or suggesting a figure without reference to motion,
while in other cases the relative position of the hands to each other and
to parts of the body are significant without any special arrangement of
the fingers. Again, in others, the lines drawn in the air by the hand or
hands execute the conception without further detail. In each case only
the essential details, when they can be ascertained, should be minutely
described.</p>



<h3><i>SUGGESTIONS FOR COLLECTING SIGNS.</i></h3>

<p>The object always should be, not to translate from English into signs,
but to ascertain the real signs and their meaning. By far the most
satisfactory
mode of obtaining this result is to induce Indians or other gesturers
observed to tell stories, make speeches, or hold talks in gesture,
with one of themselves as interpreter in his own oral language if the
latter is understood by the observer, and, if not, the words, not the
signs,
should be translated by an intermediary linguistic interpreter. It will be
easy afterward to dissect and separate the particular signs used. This
mode will determine the genuine shade of meaning of each sign, and
corresponds with the plan now adopted by the Bureau of Ethnology for
the study of the tribal vocal languages, instead of that arising out of
exclusively missionary purposes, which was to force a translation of the
Bible from a tongue not adapted to its terms and ideas, and then to
compile a grammar and dictionary from the artificial result. A little
ingenuity will direct the more intelligent or complaisant gesturers to the
expression of the thoughts, signs for which are specially sought; and
full orderly descriptions of such tales and talks with or even without
analysis and illustration are more desired than any other form of
contribution.</p>

<p>The original authorities, or the best evidence, for Indian signs&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
the Indians themselves&mdash;being still accessible, the collaborators in this
work should not be content with secondary authority. White sign talkers
and interpreters may give some genuine signs, but they are very apt
to interpolate their own improvements. Experience has led to the apparently
paradoxical judgment that the direct contribution of signs purporting
to be those of Indians, made by a habitual practitioner of signs
who is not an Indian, is less valuable than that of a discriminating
observer who is not himself an actor in gesture speech. The former,
being to himself the best authority, unwittingly invents and modifies
signs, or describes what he thinks they ought to be, often with a very
different conception from that of an Indian. Sign language not being
fixed and limited, as is the case with oral languages, expertness in it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>[pg 395]</span>
not necessarily a proof of accuracy in anyone of its forms. The proper
inquiry is not what a sign might, could, would, or should be, or what is
the best sign for a particular meaning, but what is any sign actually
used for such meaning. If any one sign is honestly invented or adopted
by any one man, whether Indian, African, Asiatic, or deaf-mute, it has
its value, but it should be identified to be in accordance with the fact
and
should not be subject to the suspicion that it has been assimilated or
garbled in interpretation. Its prevalence and special range present
considerations
of different interest and requiring further evidence.</p>

<p>The genuine signs alone should be presented to scholars, to give
their studies proper direction, while the true article can always be
adulterated
into a composite jargon by those whose ambition is only to be
sign talkers instead of making an honest contribution to ethnologic and
philologic science. The few direct contributions of interpreters to the
present work are, it is believed, valuable, because they were made without
expression of self-conceit or symptom of possession by a pet theory.</p>




<h2>MODE IN WHICH RESEARCHES HAVE BEEN MADE.</h2>


<p>It is proper to give to all readers interested in the subject, but
particularly
to those whose collaboration for the more complete work above
mentioned is solicited, an account of the mode in which the researches
have thus far been conducted and in which it is proposed to continue
them. After study of all that could be obtained in printed form, and a
considerable amount of personal correspondence, the results were embraced
in a pamphlet issued by the Bureau of Ethnology in the early
part of 1880, entitled "<i>Introduction to the Study of Sign Language among
the North American Indians as Illustrating the Gesture Speech of
Mankind.</i>"
In this, suggestions were made as to points and manner of observation
and report, and forms prepared to secure uniformity and
accuracy were explained, many separate sheets of which with the pamphlet
were distributed, not only to all applicants, but to all known and
accessible persons in this country and abroad who, there was reason to
hope, would take sufficient interest in the undertaking to contribute
their assistance. Those forms, <span class="sc">Types of Hand Positions, Outlines
of Arm Positions</span>, and <span class="sc">Examples</span>, thus distributed, are reproduced
at the end of this paper.</p>

<p>The main object of those forms was to eliminate the source of confusion
produced by attempts of different persons at the difficult description
of positions and motions. The comprehensive plan required that
many persons should be at work in many parts of the world. It will
readily be understood that if a number of persons should undertake
to describe in words the same motions, whether of pantomimists on the
stage or of other gesturers, even if the visual perception of all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>[pg 396]</span>
observers should be the same in the apprehension of the particular gestures,
their language in description might be so varied as to give very
diverse impressions to a reader who had never seen the gestures described.
But with a set form of expressions for the typical positions,
and skeleton outlines to be filled up and, when necessary, altered in a
uniform style, this source of confusion is greatly reduced. The graphic
lines drawn to represent the positions and motions on the same diagrams
will vary but little in comparison with the similar attempt of explanation
in writing. Both modes of description were, however, requested,
each tending to supplement and correct the other, and provision was
also made for the notation of such striking facial changes or emotional
postures as might individualize or accentuate the gestures. It was also
pointed out that the prepared sheets could be used by cutting and pasting
them in the proper order, for successive signs forming a speech or
story, so as to exhibit the semiotic syntax. Attention was specially
directed to the importance of ascertaining the intrinsic idea or conception
of all signs, which it was urged should be obtained directly from the
persons using them and not by inference.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1880 the prompt and industrious co-operation of
many observers in this country, and of a few from foreign lands, had
supplied a large number of descriptions which were collated and collected
into a quarto volume of 329 pages, called "<i>A Collection of Gesture
Signs and Signals of the North American Indians, with some comparisons</i>."</p>

<p>This was printed on sized paper with wide margins to allow of convenient
correction and addition. It was not published, but was regarded
as proof, a copy being sent to each correspondent with a request for his
annotations, not only in revision of his own contribution, but for its
comparison with those made by others. Even when it was supposed
that mistakes had been made in either description or reported conception,
or both, the contribution was printed as received, in order that a
number of skilled and disinterested persons might examine it and thus
ascertain the amount and character of error. The attention of each
contributor was invited to the fact that, in some instances, a sign as
described by one of the other contributors might be recognized as intended
for the same idea or object as that furnished by himself, and the
former might prove to be the better description. Each was also requested
to examine if a peculiar abbreviation or fanciful flourish might
not have induced a difference in his own description from that of another
contributor with no real distinction either in conception or essential
formation. All collaborators were therefore urged to be candid in
admitting, when such cases occurred, that their own descriptions were
mere unessential variants from others printed, otherwise to adhere to
their own and explain the true distinction. When the descriptions
showed substantial identity, they were united with the reference to all
the authorities giving them.</p>

<p>Many of these copies have been returned with valuable annotations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>[pg 397]</span>
not only of correction but of addition and suggestion, and are now being
collated again into one general revision.</p>

<p>The above statement will, it is hoped, give assurance that the work
of the Bureau of Ethnology has been careful and thorough. No scheme
has been neglected which could be contrived and no labor has been spared
to secure the accuracy and completeness of the publication still in
preparation. It may also be mentioned that although the writer has made
personal observations of signs, no description of any sign has been
printed by him which rests on his authority alone. Personal controversy
and individual bias were thus avoided. For every sign there is
a special reference either to an author or to some one or more of the
collaborators. While the latter have received full credit, full
responsibility was also imposed, and that course will be continued.</p>

<p>No contribution has been printed which asserted that any described
sign is used by "all Indians," for the reason that such statement is not
admissible evidence unless the authority had personally examined all
Indians. If any credible person had affirmatively stated that a certain
identical, or substantially identical, sign had been found by him, actually
used by Abnaki, Absaroka, Arikara, Assiniboins, etc., going through
the whole list of tribes, or any definite portion of that list, it would
have been so inserted under the several tribal heads. But the expression
"all Indians," besides being insusceptible of methodical classification,
involves hearsay, which is not the kind of authority desired in a serious
study. Such loose talk long delayed the recognition of Anthropology as
a science. It is true that some general statements of this character are
made by some old authors quoted in the Dictionary, but their descriptions
are reprinted, as being all that can be used of the past, for whatever
weight they may have, and they are kept separate from the linguistic
classification given below.</p>

<p>Regarding the difficulties met with in the task proposed, the same
motto might be adopted as was prefixed to Austin's <i>Chironomia</i>: "<i>Non
sum nescius, quantum susceperim negotii, qui motus corporis exprimere
verbis, imitari scriptura conatus sim voces.</i>" <i>Rhet. ad Herenn</i>, 1.3. If
the descriptive recital of the signs collected had been absolutely
restricted to written or printed words the work would have been still
more difficult and the result less intelligible. The facilities enjoyed of
presenting pictorial illustrations have been of great value and will give
still more assistance in the complete work than in the present paper.</p>

<p>In connection with the subject of illustrations it may be noted that
a writer in the <i>Journal of the Military Service Institution of the
United
States</i>, Vol. II, No. 5, the same who had before invented the mode of
describing
signs by "means" mentioned on page <a href="#page330">330</a> <i>supra</i>, gives a curious
distinction between deaf-mute and Indian signs regarding their respective
capability of illustration, as follows: "This French system is
taught, I believe, in most of the schools for deaf-mutes in this country,
and in Europe; but so great has been the difficulty of fixing the hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id="page398"></a>[pg 398]</span>
in space, either by written description or illustrated cuts, that no text
books are used. I must therefore conclude that the Indian sign language
is not only the more natural, but the more simple, as the gestures
can be described quite accurately in writing, and I think can be
illustrated."
The readers of this paper will also, probably, "think" that
the signs of Indians can be illustrated, and as the signs of
deaf-mutes
are often identical with the Indian, whether expressing the same or
different ideas, and when not precisely identical are always made on
the same principle and with the same members, it is not easy to imagine
any greater difficulty either in their graphic illustration or in their
written
description. The assertion is as incorrect as if it were paraphrased
to declare that a portrait of an Indian in a certain attitude could be
taken by a pencil or with the camera while by some occult influence the
same artistic skill would be paralysed in attempting that of a
deaf-mute in the same attitude. In fact, text books on the "French system"
are used and one in the writer's possession published in Paris twenty-five
years ago, contains over four hundred illustrated cuts of deaf-mute
gesture signs.</p>

<p>The proper arrangement and classification of signs will always be
troublesome and unsatisfactory. There can be no accurate translation
either of sentences or of words from signs into written English. So far
from the signs representing words as logographs, they do not in their
presentation of the ideas of actions, objects, and events, under physical
forms, even suggest words, which must be skillfully fitted to them by
the glossarist and laboriously derived from, them by the philologer. The
use of words in formulation, still more in terminology, is so wide a
departure from primitive conditions as to be incompatible with the only
primordial language yet discovered. No vocabulary of signs will be
exhaustive for the simple reason that the signs are exhaustless, nor will
it be exact because there cannot be a correspondence between signs and
words taken individually. Not only do words and signs both change
their meaning from the context, but a single word may express a complex
idea, to be fully rendered only by a group of signs, and, <i>vice
versa</i>,
a single sign may suffice for a number of words. The elementary principles
by which the combinations in sign and in the oral languages of
civilization are effected are also discrepant. The attempt must therefore
be made to collate and compare the signs according to general ideas,
conceptions, and, if possible, the ideas and conceptions of the gesturers
themselves, instead of in order of words as usually arranged in
dictionaries.</p>

<p>The hearty thanks of the writer are rendered to all his collaborators,
a list of whom is given below, and will in future be presented in a manner
more worthy of them. It remains to give an explanation of the
mode in which a large collection of signs has been made directly by the
officers of the Bureau of Ethnology. Fortunately for this undertaking,
the policy of the government brought to Washington during the year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id="page399"></a>[pg 399]</span>
1880 delegations, sometimes quite large, of most of the important tribes.
Thus the most intelligent of the race from many distant and far separated
localities were here in considerable numbers for weeks, and indeed,
in some cases, months, and, together with their interpreters and agents,
were, by the considerate order of the honorable Secretary of the Interior,
placed at the disposal of this Bureau for all purposes of gathering
ethnologic
information. The facilities thus obtained were much greater
than could have been enjoyed by a large number of observers traveling
for a long time over the continent for the same express purpose. The
observations relating to signs were all made here by the same persons,
according to a uniform method, in which the gestures were obtained
directly from the Indians, and their meaning (often in itself clear from
the context of signs before known) was translated sometimes through
the medium of English or Spanish, or of a native language known in common
by some one or more of the Indians and by some one of the observers.
When an interpreter was employed, he translated the words used
by an Indian in his oral paraphrase of the signs, and was not relied upon
to explain the signs according to his own ideas. Such translations and
a description of minute and rapidly-executed signs, dictated at the moment
of their exhibition, were sometimes taken down by a phonographer,
that there might be no lapse of memory in any particular, and in many
cases the signs were made in successive motions before the camera, and
prints secured as certain evidence of their accuracy. Not only were
more than one hundred Indians thus examined individually, at leisure,
but, on occasions, several parties of different tribes, who had never
before
met each other, and could not communicate by speech, were examined at
the same time, both by inquiry of individuals whose answers were consulted
upon by all the Indians present, and also by inducing several of
the Indians to engage in talk and story-telling in signs between
themselves.
Thus it was possible to notice the difference in the signs made
for the same objects and the degree of mutual comprehension notwithstanding
such differences. Similar studies were made by taking Indians
to the National Deaf Mute College and bringing them in contact with
the pupils.</p>

<p>By far the greater part of the actual work of the observation and
record of the signs obtained at Washington has been ably performed by
Dr. <span class="sc">W.J. Hoffman</span>, the assistant of the present writer. When the
latter has made personal observations the former has always been
present, taking the necessary notes and sketches and superintending
the photographing. To him, therefore, belongs the credit for all those
references in the following "<span class="sc">List of Authorities and Collaborators</span>,"
in which it is stated that the signs were obtained at Washington
from Indian delegations. Dr. <span class="sc">Hoffman</span> acquired in the West, through
his service as acting assistant surgeon, United States Army, at a large
reservation, the indispensable advantage of becoming acquainted with
the Indian character so as to conduct skillfully such researches as that in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>[pg 400]</span>
question, and in addition has the eye and pencil of an artist, so that he
seizes readily, describes with physiological accuracy, and reproduces in
action and in permanent illustration all shades of gesture exhibited.
Nearly all of the pictorial illustrations in this paper are from his
pencil.
For the remainder, and for general superintendence of the artistic
department
of the work, thanks are due to Mr. <span class="sc">W.H. Holmes</span>, whose high
reputation needs no indorsement here.</p>

<h2>LIST OF AUTHORITIES AND COLLABORATORS.</h2>


<p>1. A list prepared by <span class="sc">William Dunbar</span>, dated Natchez, June 30,
1800, collected from tribes then "west of the Mississippi," but probably
not from those very far west of that river, published in the
<i>Transactions
of the American Philosophical Society</i>, vol. vi, pp. 1-8, as read
January
16, 1801, and communicated by Thomas Jefferson, president of the
society.</p>

<p>2. The one published in <i>An Account of an Expedition from Pittsburgh
to the Rocky Mountains, performed in the years 1819-1820,
Philadelphia</i>,
1823, vol. i, pp. 378-394. This expedition was made by order of the
Hon. J.O. Calhoun, Secretary of War, under the command of Maj. <span class="sc">S.
H. Long</span>, of the United States Topographical Engineers, and is commonly
called James' Long's Expedition. This list appears to have been
collected chiefly by Mr. T. Say, from the Pani, and the Kansas, Otos,
Missouris, Iowas, Omahas, and other southern branches of the great
Dakota family.</p>

<p>3. The one collected by Prince <span class="sc">Maximilian von Wied-Neuwied</span> in
<i>Reise in das Innere Nord-America in den Jahren 1832 bis 1834</i>.
<i>Coblenz</i>,
1839 [&mdash;1841], vol. ii, pp. 645-653. His statement is, "the Arikaras,
Mandans, Minnitarris [Hidatsa], Crows [Absaroka], Cheyennes, Snakes
[Shoshoni], and Blackfeet [Satsika] all understand certain signs, which,
on the contrary, as we are told, are unintelligible to the Dakotas,
Assiniboins,
Ojibwas, Krihs [Crees], and other nations. The list gives examples
of the sign language of the former." From the much greater proportion
of time spent and information obtained by the author among the
Mandans and Hidatsa then and now dwelling near Port Berthold, on the
Upper Missouri, it might be safe to consider that all the signs in his list
were in fact procured from those tribes. But as the author does not say
so, he is not made to say so in this work. If it shall prove that the signs
now used by the Mandans and Hidatsa more closely resemble those on his
list than do those of other tribes, the internal evidence will be verified.
This list is not published in the English edition, <i>London</i>, 1843, but
appears
in the German, above cited, and in the French, <i>Paris</i>, 1840.
Bibliographic
reference is often made to this distinguished explorer as "Prince
Maximilian," as if there were but one possessor of that Christian name
among princely families. For brevity the reference in this paper will be
<i>Wied</i>.</p>

<p>No translation of this list into English appears to have been printed
in any shape before that recently published by the present writer in the
<i>American Antiquarian</i>, vol. ii, No. 3, while the German and French
editions
are costly and difficult of access, so the collection cannot readily
be compared by readers with the signs now made by the same tribes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page402" id="page402"></a>[pg 402]</span>
The translation, now presented is based upon the German original, but
in a few cases where the language was so curt as not to give a clear
idea, was collated with the French edition of the succeeding year,
which, from some internal evidence, appears to have been published
with the assistance or supervision of the author. Many of the descriptions
are, however, so brief and indefinite in both their German and
French forms that they necessarily remain so in the present translation.
The princely explorer, with the keen discrimination shown in all his
work, doubtless observed what has escaped many recent reporters of
Indian signs, that the latter depend much more upon motion than mere
position, and are generally large and free, seldom minute. His object
was to express the general effect of the motion rather than to describe it
with such precision as to allow of its accurate reproduction by a reader
who had never seen it. To have presented the signs as now desired for
comparison, toilsome elaboration would have been necessary, and even
that would not in all cases have sufficed without pictorial illustration.</p>

<p>On account of the manifest importance of determining the prevalence
and persistence of the signs as observed half a century ago, an exception
is made to the general arrangement hereafter mentioned by introducing
after the <i>Wied</i> signs remarks of collaborators who have made
special comparisons, and adding to the latter the respective names of
those collaborators&mdash;as, (<i>Matthews</i>), (<i>Boteler</i>). It is hoped
that the work
of those gentlemen will be imitated, not only regarding the <i>Wied</i>,
signs, but many others.</p>

<p>4. The signs given to publication by Capt. <span class="sc">R.F. Burton</span>, which, it
would be inferred, were collected in 1860-'61, from the tribes met or
learned of on the overland stage route, including Southern Dakotas,
Utes, Shoshoni, Arapahos, Crows, Pani, and Apaches. They are contained
in <i>The City of the Saints</i>, <i>New York</i>, 1862, pp. 123-130.</p>

<p>Information has been recently received to the effect that this collection
was not made by the distinguished English explorer from his personal
observation, but was obtained by him from one man in Salt Lake
City, a Mormon bishop, who, it is feared, gave his own ideas of the
formation and use of signs rather than their faithful description.</p>

<p>5. A list read by Dr. <span class="sc">D.G. Macgowan</span>, at a meeting of the American
Ethnological Society, January 23, 1866, and published in the <i>Historical
Magazine</i>, vol. x, 1866, pp. 86, 87, purporting to be the signs of the
Caddos, Wichitas, and Comanches.</p>

<p>6. Annotations by Lieut. <span class="sc">Heber M. Creel</span>, Seventh United States
Cavalry, received in January, 1881. This officer is supposed to be
specially familiar with the Cheyennes, among whom he lived for eighteen
months; but his recollection is that most of the signs described by
him were also observed among the Arapaho, Sioux, and several other
tribes.</p>

<p>7. A special contribution from Mr. <span class="sc">F.F. Gerard</span>, of Fort A. Lincoln,
D.T., of signs obtained chiefly from a deaf-mute Dakota, who has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>[pg 403]</span>
traveled among most of the Indian tribes living between the Missouri River
and the Rocky Mountains. Mr. Gerard's own observations are based
upon the experience of thirty-two years' residence in that country, during
which long period he has had almost daily intercourse with Indians.
He states that the signs contributed by him are used by the Blackfeet,
(Satsika), Absaroka, Dakota, Hidatsa, Mandan, and Arikara Indians,
who may in general be considered to be the group of tribes referred to
by the Prince of Wied.</p>

<p>In the above noted collections the generality of the statements as
to locality of the observation and use of the signs rendered it impossible
to arrange them in the manner considered to be the best to study
the diversities and agreements of signs. For that purpose it is more
convenient that the names of the tribe or tribes among which the
described signs have been observed should catch the eye in immediate
connection with them than that those of the observers only should follow.
Some of the latter indeed have given both similar and different
signs for more than one tribe, so that the use of the contributor's name
alone would create confusion. To print in every case the name of the
contributor, together with the name of the tribe, would seriously burden
the paper and be unnecessary to the student, the reference being
readily made to each authority through this <span class="sc">list</span> which also serves as
an index. The seven collections above mentioned will therefore be referred
to by the names of the authorities responsible for them. Those
which now follow are arranged alphabetically by tribes, under headings
of Linguistic Families according to Major <span class="sc">J.W. Powell</span>'s classification,

The organization of those researches in India and Ceylon has been
accomplished
through the active interest of Col. <span class="sc">H.S. Olcott</span>, U.S. Commissioner,
Breach Candy, Bombay.</p>

<hr />

<p>Grateful acknowledgment must be made to Prof. <span class="sc">E.A. Fay</span>, of the
National Deaf Mute College, through whose special attention a large
number of the natural signs of deaf-mutes, remembered by them as having
been invented and used before instruction in conventional signs,
indeed before attending any school, was obtained. The gentlemen who
made the contributions in their own MS., and without prompting, are as
follows: Messrs. <span class="sc">M. Ballard</span>, <span class="sc">R.M. Ziegler</span>, <span class="sc">J. Cross</span>, <span class="sc">Philip J.
Hasenstab</span>, and <span class="sc">Lars Larson</span>. Their names respectively follow their
several descriptions. Mr. <span class="sc">Ballard</span> is an instructor in the college, and
the other gentlemen were pupils during the session of 1880.</p>

<p>Similar thanks are due to Mr. <span class="sc">J.L. Noyes</span>, superintendent of the
Minnesota Institution for the education of the Deaf and Dumb, Faribault,
Minn., and to Messrs. <span class="sc">George Wing</span> and <span class="sc">D.H. Carroll</span>, teachers
in that institution, for annotations and suggestions respecting
deaf-mute signs. The notes made by the last named gentlemen are followed
by their respective names in reference.</p>

<hr />

<p>Special thanks are also rendered to Prof. <span class="sc">James D. Butler</span>, of Madison,
Wis., for contribution of Italian gesture-signs, noted by him in
1843, and for many useful suggestions.</p>

<hr />

<p>Other Italian signs are quoted from the Essay on Italian gesticulations
by his eminence Cardinal <span class="sc">Wiseman</span>, in his <i>Essays on Various Subjects,
London</i>, 1855, Vol. III, pp. 533-555. Many Neapolitan signs are
extracted from the illustrated work of the canon <span class="sc">Andrea de Jorio</span>, <i>La
Mimica degli Antichi investigata nel gestire Napoletano</i>, <i>Napoli</i>, 1832.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A small collection of Australian signs has been extracted from <span class="sc">R.
Brough Smyth</span>'s <i>The Aborigines of Victoria</i>, <i>London</i>, 1878.</p>

<h2>EXTRACTS FROM DICTIONARY.</h2>

<p>In the printed but unpublished <i>Collection</i> before mentioned, page
<a href="#page396">396</a>,
nearly three hundred quarto pages are devoted to descriptions of signs
arranged in alphabetic order. A few of these are now presented to
show the method adopted. They have been selected either as having
connection
with the foregoing discussion of the subject or because for some
of them pictorial illustrations had already been prepared. There is
propriety
in giving all the signs under some of the title words when descriptions
of only one or two of those signs have been used in the foregoing remarks.
This prevents an erroneous inference that the signs so mentioned are the
only or the common or the generally prevailing signs for the idea conveyed.
This course has involved some slight repetition both of descriptions
and of illustrations, as it seemed desirable that they should appear
to the eye in the several connections indicated. The extracts are rendered
less interesting and instructive by the necessity for omitting
cross-references
which would show contrasts and similarities for comparison,
but would require a much larger part of the collected material to be
now printed than is consistent with the present plan. Instead of occupying
in this manner the remaining space allotted to this paper, it was
decided to present, as of more general interest, the descriptions of
<span class="sc">Tribal Signs, Proper Names, Phrases, Dialogues, Narratives,
Discourses</span>, and <span class="sc">Signals</span>, which follow the <span class="sc">Extracts</span>.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in the following extracts there has been an
attempt to supply the conceptions or origin of the several signs.
When the supposed conception, obtained through collaborators, is
printed before the authority given as reference, it is understood to have
been gathered from an Indian as being his own conception, and is therefore
of special value. When printed after the authority and within
quotation marks it is in the words of the collaborator as offered by
himself.
When printed after the authority and without quotation marks
it is suggested by this writer.</p>

<p>The letters of the alphabet within parentheses, used in some of the
descriptions,
refer to the corresponding figures in <span class="sc">Types of Hand Positions</span>
at the end of this paper. When such letters are followed by Arabic
numerals it is meant that there is some deviation, which is described
in the text, from that type of hand position corresponding with the letter
which is still used as the basis of description. Example: In the
first description from (<i>Sahaptin</i> I) for <i>bad</i>, <i>mean</i>,
page <a href="#page412">412</a>, (G) refers to
the type of hand position so marked, being identically that position,
but in the following reference, to (R 1), the type referred to by the
letter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page410" id="page410"></a>[pg 410]</span>
R has the palm to the front instead of backward, being in all other
respects the position which it is desired to illustrate; (R), therefore,
taken
in connection with the description, indicates that change, and that alone.
This mode of reference is farther explained in the <span class="sc">Examples</span> at the end
of this paper.</p>

<p>References to another title word as explaining a part of a description
or to supply any other portions of a compound sign will always be
understood
as being made to the description by the same authority of the
sign under the other title-word. Example: In the second description
by (<i>Sahaptin</i> I) for <i>bad, mean</i>, above mentioned, the reference
to <span class="sc">Good</span>
is to that sign for <i>good</i> which is contributed by Rev. <span class="sc">G.L.
Deffenbaugh</span>,
and is referred to as (<i>Sahaptin</i> I.).</p>


<h5>ANTELOPE.</h5>

<p>Pass the open right hand outward from the small of the back. (<i>Wied</i>.)
This, as explained by Indians lately examined, indicates the lighter
coloration
upon the animal's flanks. A Ute who could speak Spanish accompanied
it with the word <i>blanco</i>, as if recognizing that it required
explanation.</p>

<p>With the index only extended, hold the hand eighteen or twenty
inches transversely in front of the head, index
pointing to the left, then rub the sides
of the body with the flat hands. (<i>Cheyenne</i>
IV; <i>Dakota</i> VI.) "The latter sign refers to
the white sides of the animal; the former could
not be explained."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:15%;"><a href="images/fig234.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig234.png" alt="Antelope. Dakota" /></a>Fig. 234.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/fig235.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig235.png" alt="Running antelope. Personal totem" /></a>Fig. 235.</div>

<p>Extend and separate the forefingers and thumbs, nearly close
all the other fingers, and place the hands with backs outward
above and a little in front of the ears, about four inches from the
head, and shake them back and forth several times. Antelope's
horns. This is an Arapaho sign. (<i>Dakota</i> I, II, IV.)</p>

<p>Close the right hand, leaving the end of the index in the form of a hook,
and the thumb extended as in Fig. 234; then wave the hand quickly back
and forth a short distance, opposite the temple. (<i>Hidatsa</i> I;
<i>Arikara</i> I.)
"Represents the pronged horn of the animal. This is the sign ordinarily
used, but it was noticed that in conversing with one of the Dakotas
the sign of the latter (<i>Dakota</i> VI) was used several times, to be
more
readily understood."</p>

<p>Place both hands, fingers fully extended and spread, close to the sides
of the head. <i>Wied's</i> sign was readily understood as signifying the
white flanks. (<i>Apache</i> I.)</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page411" id="page411"></a>[pg 411]</span>

<p>In connection with the above signs Fig. 235 is presented, which was
drawn by Running Antelope, an Uncpapa Dakota, as his personal totem,
or proper name.</p>


<h5>BAD, MEAN.</h5>

<p>Make the sign for <span class="sc">Good</span> and then that of <span class="sc">Not</span>. (<i>Long.</i>)</p>

<p>Close the hand, and open it whilst passing it downward. (<i>Wied.</i>)
This is the same as my description; but differently worded, possibly
notes a less forcible form. I say, however, that the arm is "extended."
The precise direction in which the hand is moved is not, I think,
essential.
(<i>Matthews.</i>) This sign is invariably accompanied by a countenance
expressive of contempt. (<i>F. Jacker.</i>).</p>

<p>Scatter the dexter fingers outward, as if spurting away water from
them. (<i>Burton</i>.)</p>

<p>(1) Right hand partially elevated, fingers closed, thumb clasping the
tips; (2) sudden motion downward and outward accompanied by equally
sudden opening of fingers and snapping of the fingers from the thumb.
(<i>Cheyenne</i> II.)</p>

<p>Right hand closed back to front is moved forcibly downward and forward,
the fingers being violently opened at instant of stopping the motion
of hand. (<i>Cheyenne IV.</i>)</p>

<p>Right hand closed (B) carried forward in front of the body toward the
right and downward, during which the hand is opened, fingers downward,
as if dropping out the contents. (<i>Dakota</i> I.) "Not worth keeping."</p>

<p>Half close the fingers of the right hand, hook the thumb over the fore
and middle fingers; move the hand, back upward, a foot or so toward
the object referred to, and suddenly let the fingers fly open. Scattered
around, therefore bad. An Arapaho sign. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.)</p>

<p>Close the fingers of the right hand, resting the tips against the thumb,
then throw the hand downward
and outward toward the right to
arm's length, and spring open
the fingers. Fig. 236. (<i>Dakota</i>
VI, VII, VIII; <i>Ponka</i> II; <i>Pani</i> I.)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:60%;"><a href="images/fig236.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig236.png" alt="Bad. Dakota" /></a>Fig. 236.</div>

<p>The sign most commonly used
for this idea is made by the hand
being closed near the breast, with
the back toward the breast, then
as the arm is suddenly extended
the hand is opened and the fingers separated from each other. (<i>Mandan
and Hidatsa</i> I.)</p>

<p>Hands open, palms turned in; move one hand toward, and the other
from, the body; then vice vers&#226;. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>Throw the clinched right hand forward, downward, and outward, and
when near at arm's length, suddenly snap the fingers from the thumb as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>[pg 412]</span>
if sprinkling water. (<i>Wyandot</i> I.) "To throw away contemptuously;
not worth keeping."</p>

<p>Raise hand in front of breast, fingers hooked, thumb resting against
second finger, palm downward (G), then with a nervous movement
throw the hand downward to the right and a little behind the body, with
an expression of disgust on the face. During motion of hand the fingers
are suddenly extended as though throwing something out of the
hand, and in final position the fingers and thumb are straight and
separated,
palm backward (R 1). (<i>Sahaptin</i> I.) "Away with it!"</p>

<p>Another: Same motion of arm and hand as in <i>good</i>. But in the
first position fingers are closed, and as the hand moves to the right they
are thrown open, until in final position all are extended as in final for
<i>good</i>. (<i>Sahaptin</i> I.)</p>

<p>Extend the right hand, palm downward, and move it in a horizontal
line from the body, then suddenly turn the hand over as if throwing
water from the back of it or the index. (<i>Comanche</i> I.) "Good, no."</p>

<p>Pass the flat right hand, interruptedly, downward and backward past
the right side. (<i>Pima and Papago</i> I.) "Putting aside."</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute natural signs</i>:</p>

<p>Hold forward the closed hand with the little finger up, at the same
time nodding the head. (<i>Ballard</i>.)</p>

<p>Draw the tongue out a little and then shake the head with a displeased
look. (<i>Larson</i>.)</p>

<p>Use the sign for <i>handsome</i> (see first part of the sign for <span class="sc">Good</span>), at
the
same time shake the head as if to say "no." (<i>Ziegler</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute signs</i>:</p>

<p>The hand closed (except the little finger which is extended and raised),
and held forward with the fingers to the front is the sign for <i>bad</i>
illustrated
in the Report for 1879 of the Ohio Institution for the Deaf and
Dumb. This sign is used among the deaf-mutes in England.</p>


<h5>BEAR, animal.</h5>

<p>Pass the hand before the face to mean ugliness, at the same time grinning
and extending the fingers like claws. (<i>Burton</i>.)</p>

<p>Hands in front of and about eight inches above the elbows, fingers
slightly bent and open, thumbs and palms to the front to represent
claws,&mdash;or bear in standing position. Sometimes accompanied by clawing
motion. (<i>Creel</i>.)</p>

<p>(1) Middle and third finger of right hand clasped down by the thumb,
forefinger and little finger extended, crooked downward; (2)
the motion of scratching made in the air. (<i>Cheyenne</i> II.)
Fig. 237.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:15%;"><a href="images/fig237.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig237.png" alt="Bear. Cheyenne" /></a>Fig. 237.</div>

<p>Fingers of both hands closed, except the thumb and little
finger, which are extended, and point straight toward the
front, hands horizontal, backs upward, are held in front of
their respective sides near the body, and then moved directly forward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page413" id="page413"></a>[pg 413]</span>
with, short, sharp jerking motions. (<i>Dakota</i> I.) "From the motion of
the bear in running." This is also reported as an Arapaho sign.
(<i>Dakota</i>
IV.) The paws and claws are represented.</p>

<p>Seize a short piece of wood, say about two feet long, wave in the right
hand, and strike a blow at an imaginary person. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>Another: Seize a short thing about six inches long, hold it as dagger,
pretend to thrust it downward under the breast-bone repeatedly, and
each time farther, grunting or gasping in doing so; withdraw the stick,
holding it up, and, showing the blood, point to the breast with the left
forefinger, meaning to say <i>so do thou when you meet the bear</i>.
(<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>Another: Pretend to stab yourself with an arrow in various parts of
the body, then point towards the body with the left-hand forefinger.
(<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>Arms are flexed and hands clasped about center of breast; then slowly
fall with arms pendulous and both hands in type-position (Q). The sign
is completed by slowly lifting the hands and arms several times in
imitation
of the animal's locomotion. Movement and appearance of animal's
front feet. (<i>Oto</i> I.)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:15%;"><a href="images/fig238.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig238.png" alt="Bear. Kaiowa, etc." /></a>Fig. 238.</div>

<p>Hold the closed right hand at the height of the elbow before the right
side, palm downward, extend and curve the thumb and
little finger so that their tips are nearly directed toward
one another before the knuckles of the closed fingers;
then push the hand forward several times. (<i>Kaiowa</i> I;
<i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i> II; <i>Wichita</i> II.) "Paw and long
claws." Fig. 238.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:15%;"><a href="images/fig239.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig239.png" alt="Bear. Ute" /></a>Fig. 239.</div>

<p>Hold both closed hands before the body, palms down, and about eight
inches apart; reach forward a short distance, relaxing
the fingers as if grasping something with them, and
draw them back again as the hands are withdrawn to their
former position. Ordinarily but one hand is used, as
in Fig. 239. (<i>Ute</i> I.) "Scratching, and grasping with the claws."</p>

<p>The right hand thrown in the position as for <i>horse</i>, as follows:
Elevate the right-hand, extended, with fingers joined, outer edge
toward the ground, in front of the body or right shoulder, and pointing
forward, resting the curved thumb against the palmar side of the
index, then extend both hands with fingers extended and curved, separated,
palms down, and push them forward several times, making
a short arch. (<i>Apache</i> I.) "The animal that scratches with
long claws."</p>

<h5>BRAVE.</h5>

<p>Close the fists, place the left near the breast, and move the right over
the left toward the left side. (<i>Wied</i>.) A motion
something like this, which I do not now
distinctly recall&mdash;a short of wrenching motion
with the fists in front of the chest&mdash;I have seen
used for <i>strong</i>. If <i>Wied's</i> sign-maker's hand
first struck the region over the heart (as he may
have done) he would then have indicated a
"strong heart," which is the equivalent for
<i>brave</i>. (<i>Matthews</i>.) This sign is used by the
Sioux at the present day to denote <i>small</i>.
(<i>McChesney</i>.) I have seen a similar sign repeatedly,
the only variation being that the right
fist is passed over and downward, in front of
the left, instead of toward the left side. (<i>Hoffman</i>.) Fig. 241.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/fig241.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig241.png" alt="Brave. N.A. Indian" /></a>Fig. 241.</div>

<p>Clinch the right fist, and place it to the breast. (<i>Absaroka</i> I;
<i>Shoshoni and Banak</i> I.)</p>

<p>Both hands fists, backs outward, obliquely upward, near together,
right inside of left, are moved forward from in front of the chest, two or
three times and back again to original position and then the right-hand
fist is thrown with some force over the left on a curve. <i>Endurance</i>
is
expressed by this sign, and it is connected with the sun-dance trials of
the young man in testing his bravery and powers of endurance before
admission to the ranks of the warriors. (<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<p>Push the two fists forward about a foot, at the height of the breast,
the right about two inches behind the left, palms inward. (<i>Dakota</i>
IV.) "The hands push all before them."</p>

<p>Hold the left arm in front as if supporting a shield, and the right
drawn back as if grasping a weapon. Close the fists, lower the head,
moving it a little forward (with a "lunge") as well as the arms and fists..
(<i>Omaha</i> I.) "I am brave."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page415" id="page415"></a>[pg 415]</span>

<p>Another: Index and thumb extended parallel, palm to left, the other
fingers bent. Shake the open fingers several times at the person referred
to, the forearm being held at an angle of about 20&#176;. (<i>Omaha</i> I.) "You
are very brave; you do not fear death when you see the danger."</p>

<p>Strike the breast gently with the palmar side of the right fist.
(<i>Wyandot</i> I.)</p>

<p>Place the left clinched hand horizontally before the breast, palm
toward the body, and at the same time strike forcibly downward in
front of it with the right fist, as in Fig. 242.
Sometimes the right fist is placed back of
the left, then thrown over the latter toward
the front and downward, as in Fig. 241
above. The same gesture has also been
made by throwing the palmar side of the
right fist edgewise downward in front of the
knuckles of the left, as in Fig. 243. In each
instance the left fist is jerked upward very
perceptibly as the right one is thrust downward.
(<i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i>
II; <i>Wichita</i> II.)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/fig242.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig242.png" alt="Brave. Kaiowa, etc." /></a>Fig. 242.</div>

<p>Strike the clinched fist forcibly toward
the ground in front of and near the breast. (<i>Arikara</i> I.)</p>


<p>&mdash;&mdash; He is the bravest of all.</p>

<p>Make the sign for <span class="sc">Brave</span> and then the left forefinger, upright, back
inward about twelve inches in front of
left breast, right index similarly held
near the right breast, move them at the
same time outward or forward, obliquely
to the left, (<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/fig243.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig243.png" alt="Brave. Kaiowa, etc." /></a>Fig. 243.</div>

<p>Raise right hand, fingers extended,
palm downward (W 1), swing it around
"over all," then point to the man, raise
left fist (A 1, changed to left and palm
inward) to a point in front of and near the body, close fingers of right
hand and place the fist (A 2, palm inward) between left fist and body
and then with violent movement throw it over left fist, as though breaking
something, and stop at a point in front of and a little below left fist,
and lastly point upward with right hand. (<i>Sahaptin</i> I.) "Of all here
he is strongest."</p>

<p>The right fist, palm downward, is struck against the breast several
times, and the index is then quickly elevated before the face, pointing
upward. (<i>Apache</i> I.)</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page416" id="page416"></a>[pg 416]</span>

<p>Move the fist, thumb to the head, across the forehead from right to
left, and cast it toward the earth over the left shoulder. (<i>Apache</i>
III.)</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute natural signs</i>:</p>

<p>Run forward with a bold expression of the countenance. (<i>Larson</i>.)</p>

<p>Not to run back but to run forward. (<i>Ziegler</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute sign</i>:</p>

<p>Left hand held as if pressing a loaf against the chest. Make a motion
with the right hand, palm upward as if cutting through the fingers of
the left with a sawing motion. (<i>Wing</i>.)</p>

<p>Other remarks connected with the signs for <i>brave</i> appear on pages

<h5>CHIEF.</h5>

<p>The forefinger of the right hand extended, pass it perpendicularly
downward, then turn it upward, and raise it in a right line as high as
the head. (<i>Long</i>.) "Rising above others."</p>

<p>Raise the index finger of the right hand, holding it straight upward,
then turn it in a circle and bring it straight down, a little toward the
earth. (<i>Wied</i>.) The right hand is raised, and in position (J)
describes
a semicircle as in beginning the act of throwing. The arm is elevated
perfectly erect aside of the head, the palm of the index and hand should
be outward. There is an evident similarity in both execution and conception
of this sign and <i>Wied's</i>; the little variation may be the result of
different interpretation. The idea of superiority is most prominent in
both. (<i>Boteler</i>.) "A prominent one before whom all succumb." The
Arikaras understood this sign, and they afterwards used it in talking to
me. (<i>Creel</i>.) <i>Wied's</i> air-picture reminds of the royal scepter
with its sphere.</p>

<p>Raise the forefinger, pointed upwards, in a vertical direction, and then
reverse both finger and motion; the greater the elevation the "bigger"
the chief. (<i>Arapaho</i> I.)</p>

<p>Place the closed hand, with the index extended and pointing upward,
near the right cheek, pass it upward as high as the head, then turn it
forward and downward toward the ground, the movement terminating
a little below the initial point. See Fig. 306 in <span class="sc">Tendoy-Huerito
Dialogue</span>, p. <a href="#page487">487</a>. (<i>Arapaho</i> II; <i>Cheyenne</i> V; <i>Ponka</i> II;
<i>Shoshoni</i> I.)</p>

<p>(1) Sign for <span class="sc">Man</span>, as follows: Right hand, palm inward, elevated to
about the level of the breast, index carelessly pointing upward, suddenly
pointed straight upward, and the whole hand moved a little forward, at
the same time taking care to keep the back of the hand toward the person
addressed; (2) middle, third, little finger, and thumb slightly closed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id="page417"></a>[pg 417]</span>
together, forefinger pointing forward and downward; (3) curved motion
made forward, outward, and downward. (<i>Cheyenne</i> II.) "He who
stands still and commands," as shown by similarity of signs to <i>sit
here</i> or <i>stand here</i>.</p>

<p>Extend the index, remaining fingers closed, and raise it to the right
side of the head and above it as far as the arm can reach. Have also
seen the sign given by <i>Wyandot</i> I. (<i>Ojibwa</i> V.)</p>

<p>The extended forefinger of the right hand (J), of which the other fingers
are closed, is raised to the right side of the head and above it as
far as the arm can be extended, and then the hand is brought down in
front of the body with the wrist bent, the back of hand in front and the
extended forefinger pointing downward. (<i>Dakota</i> I.) "Raised above
others."</p>

<p>Move the upright and extended right index, palm forward, from the
shoulder upward as high, as the top of the head, then forward six inches
through a curve, and move it forward six inches, and then downward,
its palm backward, to the height of the shoulder. An Arapaho sign,
Above all others. He looks over or after us. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.)</p>

<p>Elevate the extended index before the shoulder, palm forward, pass
it upward as high as the head, and forming a short curve to the front,
then downward again slightly to the front to before the breast and about
fifteen inches from it. (<i>Dakota</i> VI, VII, VIII; <i>Hidatsa</i> I;
<i>Arikara</i> I.)</p>

<p>Right hand closed, forefinger pointing up, raise the hand from the
waist in front of the body till it passes above the head. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>Another: Bring the closed right hand, forefinger pointing up, on
a level with the face; then bring the palm of the left hand with force
against the right forefinger; next send up the right hand above the
head, leaving the left as it is. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>The right arm is extended by side of head, with the hand in position
(J). The arm and hand then descend, the finger describing a semicircle
with the arm as a radius. The sign stops with arm hanging at full
length. (<i>Oto</i> I.) "The arm of authority before whom all must fall."</p>

<p>Both hands elevated to a position in front of and as high as the shoulders,
palms facing, fingers and thumbs spread and slightly curved; the
hands are then drawn outward a short distance towards their respective
sides and gently elevated as high as the top of the head. (<i>Wyandot</i>
I.)
"One who is elevated by others."</p>

<p>Elevate the closed hand&mdash;index only extended and pointing upward&mdash;to
the front of the right side of the face or neck or shoulder; pass it
quickly upward, and when as high as the top of the head, direct it forward
and downward again toward the ground. (<i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Comanche</i>
III; <i>Apache</i> II; <i>Wichita</i> II.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page418" id="page418"></a>[pg 418]</span>
Close the right hand, index raised, extended, and placed before the
breast, then move it forward from the mouth, pointing forward, until at
arm's length. (<i>Ute</i> I.)</p>


<p>&mdash;&mdash;, Head, of tribe.</p>

<p>Place the extended index, pointing upward, at some distance before
the right shoulder, then place the left hand, with fingers and thumb
extended and separated, just back of the index; then in
passing the index upward as high as the head, draw the
left hand downward a short distance, as in Fig. 244. Superior
to others. (<i>Absaroka</i> I; <i>Arikara</i> I.)</p>

<p>Place both flat hands before the body, palms down,
and pass them horizontally outward toward their respective
sides, then make the sign for <span class="sc">Chief</span>. (<i>Arikara</i> I.) "Chief
of the wide region and those upon it."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:15%;"><a href="images/fig244.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig244.png" alt="Chief. Head of tribe. Absaroka" /></a>Fig. 244.</div>

<p>After pointing out the man, point to the
ground, all fingers closed except first
(J 1, pointing downward in stead of upward),
then point upward with same hand
(J 2), then move hand to a point in front of
body, fingers extended, palm downward
(W 1), and move around horizontally.
(<i>Sahaptin</i> I.) "In this place he is head over all."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/fig245.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig245.png" alt="Chief. Head of tribe. Pai-Ute" /></a>Fig. 245.</div>

<p>Grasp the forelock with the right hand, palm backward, pass the hand
upward about six inches and hold it in that position a moment.
(<i>Pai-Ute</i> I.) Fig 245.</p>

<p>Elevate the extended index vertically above and in front of the head,
holding the left hand, forefinger pointing upward, from one to two feet
below and underneath the right, the position of the left, either elevated
or depressed, also denoting the relative position of the second individual
to that of the chief. (<i>Apache</i> I.)</p>


<p>&mdash;&mdash;, War. Head of a war party; Partisan.</p>

<p>First make the sign of the <i>pipe</i>; then open the thumb and index
finger
of the right hand, back of the hand outward, moving it forward and
upward in a curve. (<i>Wied</i>.) For remarks upon this sign see page <a href="#page384">384</a>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page419" id="page419"></a>[pg 419]</span>

<p>Place the right hand, index only extended and pointing forward and
upward, before the right side of the breast nearly at arm's length, then
place the left hand, palm forward with fingers spread and extended,
midway between the breast and the right hand. (<i>Arapaho</i> II;
<i>Cheyenne</i>
V; <i>Ponka</i> II; <i>Pani</i> I.)</p>

<p>First make the sign for <span class="sc">Battle</span>, viz: Both hands (A 1) brought to the
median line of the body on a level with the breast and close together;
describe with both hands at the same time a series of circular movements
of small circumference; and then add the sign for <span class="sc">Chief</span>, (<i>Dakota</i>
I.) "First in battle."</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; of a band.</p>

<p>Point toward the left and front with the extended forefinger of the
left hand, palm down; then place the extended index about twelve
inches behind the left hand, pointing in the same direction.
(<i>Arapaho</i>
II; <i>Cheyenne</i> V; <i>Ponka</i> II; <i>Pani</i> I.)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:70%;"><a href="images/fig246.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig246.png" alt="Chief of a band. Absaroka and Arikara" /></a>Fig. 246.</div>

<p>Place the extended index at some distance before the right shoulder,
pointing forward and slightly upward,
then place the left hand with
fingers and thumb extended and separated over the
index, and while pushing the index to the front, draw the left hand
backward toward body and to the left. Ahead of others. (<i>Absaroka</i> I;
<i>Arikara</i> I.) Fig. 246.</p>

<p>Point the extended index forward and upward before the chest, then
place the spread fingers of the left
hand around the index, but at a short
distance behind it, all pointing the
same direction. Ahead of the remainder.
(<i>Arikara</i> I.)</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:45%;"><a href="images/fig247.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig247.png" alt="Chief of a band. Pai-Ute" /></a>Fig. 247.</div>

<p>Grasp the forelock with the right hand, palm backward, and pretend to
lay the hair down over the right side of the head by passing the hand in
that direction. (<i>Pai-Ute</i> I.) Fig. 247.</p>

<p>The French deaf-mute sign for <i>order, command</i>, maybe compared with
several of the above signs. In it the index tip first touches the lower lip,
then is raised above the head and brought down with violence.
(<i>L'enseignment
primaire des sourds-muets; par M. P&#233;lissier. Paris, 1856</i>.)</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420"></a>[pg 420]</span>

<p>Not only in Naples, but, according to De Jorio, in Italy generally the
conception of <i>authority</i> in gesture is by pressing the right hand on
the flank, accompanied by an erect and squared posture of the bust with
the head slightly inclined to the right. The idea of <i>substance</i> is
conveyed.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:60%;"><a href="images/fig248.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig248.png" alt="Warrior. Absaroka, etc." /></a>Fig. 248.</div>


<p>&mdash;&mdash;, Warrior lower than actual, but distinguished for bravery.</p>

<p>Place the left forefinger, pointing toward the left
and front, before the left side of the chest, then
place the extended index near (or against) the forefinger,
and, while passing the latter outward toward the left, draw the
index toward the right. (<i>Absaroka</i> I; <i>Arikara</i> I;
<i>Shoshoni</i> I.) Fig. 248.</p>


<h5>DEAD, DEATH.</h5>

<p>Throw the forefinger from the perpendicular into a horizontal position
toward the earth, with the back downward. (<i>Long</i>.)</p>

<p>Hold the left hand flat over the face, back outward, and pass with the
similarly held right hand below the former, gently striking or touching
it. (<i>Wied</i>.) The sign given (<i>Oto and Missouri</i> I) has no
similarity in
execution or conception with <i>Wied's</i>. (<i>Boteler</i>.) This sign may
convey
the idea of <i>under</i> or <i>burial</i>, quite differently executed from
most others
reported. Dr. McChesney conjectures this sign to be that of wonder or
surprise at hearing of a death, but not a distinct sign for the latter.</p>

<p>The finger of the right hand passed to the left hand and then cast
down. (<i>Macgowan</i>.)</p>

<p>Hold the left hand slightly arched, palm down, fingers pointing
toward the right about fifteen inches before the breast, then place the
extended index nearer the breast, pointing toward the left, pass it
quickly forward underneath the left hand and in an upward curve to
termination. (<i>Arapaho</i> II; <i>Cheyenne</i> V; <i>Ponka</i> II;
<i>Pani</i> I.)</p>

<p>Place the palm of the hand at a short distance from the side of the
head, then withdrawing it gently in an oblique downward direction and
inclining the head and upper part of the body in the same direction.
(<i>Ojibwa</i> II.) See page <a href="#page353">353</a> for remarks upon this sign.</p>

<p>Hold both hands open, with palms over ears, extend fingers back on
brain, close eyes, and incline body a little forward and to right or left
very low, and remain motionless a short time, pronouncing the word
<i>Ke-nee-boo</i> slowly. (<i>Ojibwa</i> IV.)</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page421" id="page421"></a>[pg 421]</span>

<p>Left hand flattened and held back upward, thumb inward in front of
and a few inches from the breast. Right hand slightly clasped, forefinger
more extended than the others, and passed suddenly under the
left hand, the latter being at the same time gently moved toward the
breast. (<i>Cheyenne</i> II.) "Gone under."</p>

<p>Both hands horizontal in front of body, backs outward, index of each
hand alone extended, the right index is passed under the left with a
downward, outward and then upward and inward curved motion at the
same time that the left is moved inward toward the body two or three
inches, the movements being ended on the same level as begun. "Upset,
keeled over." For <i>many deaths</i> repeat the sign many times. The
sign of (<i>Cheyenne</i> II) expresses "gone under," but is not used in the
sense of <i>death, dead</i>, but <i>going under a cover</i>, as entering a
lodge, under a table, &amp;c. (<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<p>Make the sign for <span class="sc">Alive</span>, viz.: The right hand, back upward, is to be
at the height of the elbow and forward, the index extended and pointing
forward, the other fingers closed, thumb against middle finger; then,
while rotating the hand outward, move it to a position about four inches
in front of the face, the back looking forward and the index pointing
upward; then the sign for No. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.)</p>

<p>Another: Hold the left hand pointing toward the right, palm obliquely
downward and backward, about a foot in front of the lower part of the
chest, and pass the right hand pointing toward the left, palm downward,
from behind forward underneath it. Or from an upright position in
front of the face, back forward, index extended and other fingers closed,
carry the right hand downward and forward underneath the left and
about four inches beyond it, gradually turning the right hand until its
back is upward and its index points toward the left. An Arapaho sign.
Gone under or buried. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.)</p>

<p>Hold the left hand slightly bent with the palm down, before the breast,
then pass the extended right hand, pointing toward the left, forward
under and beyond the left. (<i>Dakota</i> VI, VII.)</p>

<p>Hold the right hand, flat, palm downward, before the body; then throw
it over on its back to the right, making a curve of about fifteen inches.
(<i>Dakota</i> VI; <i>Hidatsa</i> I; <i>Arikara</i> I.) The gesture of
reversal in this
and other instances may be compared with picture-writings in which
the reversed character for the name or totem of a person signifies his
death. One of these is given in Fig. 249, taken from Schoolcraft's <i>Hist.
Am. Tribes</i>, I, p. 356, showing the cedar burial post or
<i>adjedatig</i> of Wabojeeg,
an Ojibwa war chief, who died on Lake Superior about 1793. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page422" id="page422"></a>[pg 422]</span>
belonged to the deer clan of his tribe and the animal is drawn reversed
on the post.</p>

<p>Extend right hand, palm down, hand curved. Turn the palm up in
moving the hand down towards the earth. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>The countenance is brought to a sleeping
composure with the eyes closed. This
countenance being gradually assumed, the
head next falls toward either shoulder.
The arms having been closed and crossed
upon the chest with the hands in type
positions (B B) are relaxed and drop simultaneously
towards the ground, with the fall of the head. This attitude is
maintained some seconds. (<i>Oto and Missouri</i>
I.) "The bodily appearance at death."</p>

<p>Place the open hand, back upward, fingers
a little drawn together, at the height
of the breast, pointing forward; then move
it slowly forward and downward, turning it over at the same time.
(<i>Iroquois</i> I.) "To express 'gone into the earth, face upward.'"</p>

<p>The flat right hand is waved outward and downward toward the same
side, the head being inclined in the same direction at the time, with
eyes closed. (<i>Wyandot</i> I.)</p>

<p>Hold the left hand loosely extended about fifteen inches in front of the
breast, palm down, then pass the index, pointing to the left, in a short
curve downward, forward, and upward beneath the left palm. (<i>Kaiowa</i>
I; <i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i> II; <i>Wichita</i> II.)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:60%;"><a href="images/fig250.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig250.png" alt="Dead. Shoshoni and Banak" /></a>Fig. 250.</div>

<p>Bring the left hand to the left breast, hand half clinched (H), then
bring the right hand to the left
with the thumb and forefinger
in such a position as if you were
going to take a bit of string
from the fingers of the left hand,
and pull the right hand off in a
horizontal line as if you were
stretching a string out, extend
the hand to the full length of
the arm from you and let the index
finger point outward at the
conclusion of the sign. (<i>Comanche</i> I.) "Soul going to happy
hunting-grounds."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page423" id="page423"></a>[pg 423]</span>

<p>The left hand is held slightly arched, palm down, nearly at arm's
length before the breast; the right extended, flat, palm down, and
pointing forward, is pushed from the top of the breast, straightforward,
underneath, and beyond the left. (<i>Shoshoni and Banak</i> I.) Fig. 250.</p>

<p>Close both eyes, and after a moment throw the palm of the right hand
from the face downward and outward toward the right side, the head
being dropped in the same direction. (<i>Ute</i> I.)</p>

<p>Touch the breast with the extended and joined fingers of the right
hand, then throw the hand, palm to the left, outward toward the right,
leaning the head in that direction at the same time. (<i>Apache</i> I.)</p>

<p>Close the eyes with the tips of the index and second finger, respectively,
then both hands are placed side by side, horizontally, palms downward,
fingers extended and united; hands separated by slow horizontal
movement to right and left. (<i>Kutchin</i> I.)</p>

<p>Palm of hand upward, then a wave-like motion toward the ground.
(<i>Zun&#x0304;i</i> I.)</p>


<p><i>Deaf-mute natural signs</i>:</p>

<p>Place the hand upon the cheek, and shut the eyes, and move the hand
downward toward the ground. (<i>Ballard.</i>)</p>

<p>Let your head lie on the open hand with eyes shut. (<i>Cross.</i>)</p>

<p>Use the right shut hand as if to draw a screw down to fasten the lid
to the coffin and keep the eyes upon the hand. (<i>Hasenstab.</i>)</p>

<p>Move the head toward the shoulder and then close the eyes. (<i>Larson.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Deaf mute signs</i>:</p>

<p>The French deaf-mute conception is that of gently falling or sinking,
the right index falling from the height of the right shoulder upon the
left forefinger, toward which the head is inclined.</p>

<p>The deaf-mute sign commonly used in the United States is the same
as <i>Dakota</i> VI; <i>Hidatsa</i> I; <i>Arikara</i> I; above. Italians
with obvious conception,
make the sign of the cross.</p>


<p>&mdash;&mdash; To Die.</p>

<p>Right hand, forefinger extended, side up, forming with the thumb
a 'U'; the other fingers slightly curved, touching each other, the little
finger having its side toward the ground. Move the hand right and left
then forward, several times; then turn it over suddenly, letting it fall
toward the earth. (<i>Ojibwa</i> V; <i>Omaha</i> I.) "An animal wounded,
but
staggering a little before it falls and dies."</p>

<p>Hold the left hand as in <i>dead</i>; pass the index in the same manner
underneath the left, but in a slow, gentle, interrupted movement.

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Nearly, but recovers.</p>

<p>Hold the left hand as in <i>dead</i>; pass the index with a slow, easy,
interrupted
movement downward, under the left palm, as in <i>dying</i>, but
before passing from under the palm on the opposite side return the index
in the same manner to point of starting; then elevate it. (<i>Kaiowa</i> I;
<i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i> II; <i>Wichita</i> II.) Fig. 252.</p>

<h5>GOOD.</h5>

<p>The hand held horizontally, back upward, describes with the arm a
horizontal curve outward. (<i>Long.</i>) This is like the Eurasian motion
of benediction, but may more suggestively be compared with several of
the signs for <i>yes</i>, and in opposition to several of those for
<i>bad</i> and <i>no</i>,
showing the idea of acceptance or selection of objects presented, instead
of their rejection.</p>

<p>Place the right hand horizontally in front of the breast and move it
forward. (<i>Wied.</i>) This description is essentially the same as the one
I
furnished. (<i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i> I.) I stated, however, that the hand
was moved outward (<i>i.e.</i>, to the right). I do not remember seeing it
moved directly forward. In making the motion as I have described it
the hand would have to go both outward and forward. (<i>Matthews</i>.)
The left arm is elevated and the hand held in position (W). The arm
and hand are thus extended from the body on a level with the chest;
the elbow being slightly bent, the arm resembles a bent bow. The right
arm is bent and the right hand, in position (W), sweeps smoothly over
the left arm from the biceps muscle over the ends of the fingers. This
sign and <i>Wied's</i> are noticeably similar. The difference is, the
<i>Oto</i> sign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page425" id="page425"></a>[pg 425]</span>
uses the left arm in conjunction and both <i>more to the left</i>. The
conception
is of something that easily passes; smoothness, evenness, etc., in
both. (<i>Boteler</i>.)</p>

<p>Wave the hand from the mouth, extending the thumb from the index
and closing the other three fingers. This sign also means <i>I know</i>.
(<i>Burton</i>.)</p>

<p>(1) Right-hand fingers pointing to the left placed on a level with
mouth, thumb inward; (2) suddenly moved with curve outward so as
to present palm to person addressed. (<i>Cheyenne</i> II.)</p>

<p>Pass the open right hand, palm downward, from the heart, twenty-four
inches horizontally forward and to the right through an arc of about
90&#176;. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.) "Heart easy or smooth."</p>

<p>Another: Gently strike the chest two or three times over the heart
with the radial side of the right hand, the fingers partly flexed and
pointing downward. An Arapaho sign. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.)</p>

<p>Place the flat right hand, palm down, thumb touching the breast, then
move it forward and slightly upward and to the right. (<i>Arapaho</i> II;
<i>Cheyenne</i> V; <i>Ojibwa</i> V; <i>Dakota</i> VI, VII, VIII; <i>Kaiowa</i>
I; <i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i> II; <i>Wichita</i> II.)</p>

<p>Pass the flat hand, palm down, from the breast forward and in a slight
curve to the right. (<i>Dakota</i> VI; <i>Hidatsa</i> I; <i>Ankara</i> I.)</p>

<p>The extended right hand, palm downward, thumb backward, fingers
pointing to the left, is held nearly or quite in contact with the body
about on a level with the stomach; it is then carried outward to the
right a foot or two with a rapid sweep, in which the forearm is moved
but not necessarily the humerus. (<i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i> I.)</p>

<p>Move right hand, palm down, over the blanket, right and left, several
times. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>Another: Hit the blanket, first on the right, then on the left, palm
down, several times. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>Another: Point at the object with the right forefinger, shaking it a
little up and down, the other fingers being closed. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>Another: Same as preceding, but with the hand open, the thumb
crooked under and touching the forefinger; hand held at an angle of 45&#176;
while shaking a little back and forth. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>Another: Hold the closed hands together, thumbs up; separate by
turning the wrists down, and move the fists a little apart; then reverse
movements till back to first position. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>Another: Hold the left hand with back toward the ground, fingers
and thumb apart, and curved; hold the right hand opposite it, palm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>[pg 426]</span>
down, hands about six inches apart; shake the hands held thus, up
and down, keeping them the same distance apart. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>Another: Hold the hands with the palms in, thumbs up, move hands
right and left, keeping them about six inches apart. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>Another: Look at the right hand, first on the back, then on the palm,
then on the back again. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>The flat right hand, palm down, is moved forward and upward, starting
at a point about twelve inches before the breast. (<i>Wyandot</i> I.)</p>

<p>Hold the flat right hand forward and slightly outward from the shoulder,
palm either upward or downward, and pass it edgewise horizontally
to the right and left. This sign was made when no personality was
involved. The same gesturer when claiming for himself the character
of goodness made the following: Rapidly pat the breast with the flat
right hand. (<i>Pima and Papago</i> I.)</p>

<p>Throw right hand from front to side, fingers extended and palm down,
forearm horizontal. (<i>Sahaptin</i> I.)</p>

<p>Make an inclination of the body forward, moving at the same time
both hands forward from the breast, open, with the palm upward, and
gradually lowering them. This is also used for <i>glad, pleased</i>.
(<i>Iroquois</i> I.)</p>

<p>Bring both hands to the front, arms extended, palms outward; elevate
them upward and slightly forward; the face meanwhile expressive of
wonder. (<i>Comanche</i> I.)</p>

<p>Bring the hand opposite the breast, a little below, hand extended,
palm downward (W), and let it move off in a horizontal direction. If
it be very good, this may be repeated. If comparatively good, repeat
it more violently. (<i>Comanche</i> I.)</p>

<p>Hold the right hand palm down, pointing to the left, and placed
horizontally
before the breast, then raise it several times slightly. Good
and glad. (<i>Kutchin</i> I.)</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute natural signs</i>:</p>

<p>Smack the lips. (<i>Ballard</i>.)</p>

<p>Close the hand while the thumb is up, and nod the head and smile as
if to approve of something good. (<i>Hasenstab</i>.)</p>

<p>Point the forefinger to the mouth and move the lips with a pleased
look as if tasting sweet fruit. (<i>Larson</i>.)</p>

<p>Use the sign for <i>handsome</i> by drawing the outstretched palm of the
right hand down over the right cheek; at the same time nod the head as
if to say "yes." (<i>Ziegler</i>.)</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page427" id="page427"></a>[pg 427]</span>

<p><i>Deaf-mute signs</i>:</p>

<p>Some of the Indian signs appear to be connected with a pleasant taste
in the month, as is the sign of the French and American deaf-mutes, waving
thence the hand, either with or without touching the lips, back upward,
with fingers straight and joined, in a forward and downward curve.
They make nearly the same gesture with hand sidewise for general assent:
"Very well!"</p>

<p>The conventional sign for <i>good</i>, given in the illustration to the
report
of the Ohio Institution for the education of the deaf and dumb, is: The
right hand raised forward and closed, except the thumb, which is extended
upward, held vertically, its nail being toward the body; this is
in opposition to the sign for <i>bad</i> in the same illustration, the one
being
merely the exhibition of the thumb toward and the other of the little
finger away from the body. They are English signs, the traditional
conception being acceptance and rejection respectively.</p>

<p><i>Italian signs</i>:</p>

<p>The fingers gathered on the mouth, kissed and stretched out and spread,
intimate a dainty morsel. The open hand stretched out horizontally, and
gently shaken, intimates that a thing is so-so, not good and not bad.
(<i>Butler</i>.) Compare also the Neapolitan sign given by De Jorio, see
Fig.
62, p. <a href="#page286">286</a>, <i>supra</i>. Cardinal Wiseman gives as the Italian sign for
<i>good</i>
"the hand thrown upwards and the head back with a prolonged ah!"
<i>Loc. cit.</i>, p. 543.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Heart is.</p>

<p>Strike with right hand on the heart and make the sign for <span class="sc">Good</span> from
the heart outward. (<i>Cheyenne</i> II.)</p>

<p>Touch the left breast over the heart two or three times with the ends
of the fingers of the right hand; then make the sign for <span class="sc">Good</span>.
(<i>Dakota</i>
IV.)</p>

<p>Place the fingers of the flat right hand over the breast, then make the
sign for <span class="sc">Good</span>. (<i>Dakota</i> VII.)</p>

<p>Move hand to position in front of breast, fingers extended, palm downward
(W), then with quick movement throw hand forward and to the
side to a point 12 or 15 inches from body, hand same as in first position.
(<i>Sahaptin</i> I.)</p>

<p>The fingers of both hands extended and slightly separated, then those
of the right are placed into the several spaces between those of the left,
the tips extending to about the first joints. (<i>Absaroka</i> I.) "From
the arrangement of the logs in a log building."</p>

<p>Both hands extended, fingers spread, place those of the right into the

<p>Both hands are held edgewise before the body, palms facing, spread
the fingers, and place those of one hand into the spaces between those
of the other, so that the tips of each protrude about an inch
beyond. (<i>Hidatsa</i> I; <i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Arikara</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> III;
<i>Apache</i> II; <i>Wichita</i> II.) "The arrangement of logs in a frontier
house." Fig. 253. In connection with this sign compare the
pictograph, Fig. 204, page <a href="#page379">379</a>, <i>supra</i>. In ordinary conversation
the sign for <i>white man's house</i> is often dropped, using instead
the generic term employed for <i>lodge</i>, and this in turn is
often abbreviated, as by the Kaiowas, Comanches, Wichitas,
and others, by merely placing the tips of the extended forefingers
together, leaving the other fingers and thumbs closed, with the
wrists about three or four inches apart.</p>

<p>Both hands held pointing forward, edges down, fingers extended and
slightly separated, then place the fingers of one hand into the spaces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page429" id="page429"></a>[pg 429]</span>
between the fingers of the other, allowing the tips of the fingers of
either
hand to protrude as far as the first joint, or near it. (<i>Shoshoni and
Banak</i> I.) "From the appearance of a corner of a log
house&mdash;protruding and alternate layers of logs."</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;, Stone; Fort.</p>

<p>Strike the back of the right fist against the palm of the left hand, the
left palm backward, the fist upright ("idea of resistance or strength");
then with both hands opened, relaxed, horizontal, and palms backward,
place the ends of the right fingers behind and against the ends of the
left; then separate them, and moving them backward, each through a
semicircle, bring their bases together. The latter sign is also that of
the Arapahos for <i>house</i>. An inclosure. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.) The first
part of
this sign is that for <i>stone</i>.</p>

<h5>&mdash;&mdash; LODGE, TIPI, WIGWAM.</h5>

<p>The two hands are reared together in the form of the roof of a house,
the ends of the fingers upward. (<i>Long</i>.)</p>

<p>Place the opened thumb and forefinger of each hand opposite each
other, as if to make a circle, but leaving between them a small interval;
afterward move them from above downward simultaneously (which is
the sign for <i>village</i>); then elevate the finger to indicate the
number&mdash;one.
(<i>Wied</i>.) Probably he refers to an earthen lodge. I think that the
sign I have given you is nearly the same with all the Upper Missouri
Indians. (<i>Matthews</i>.)</p>

<p>Place the fingers of both hands ridge-fashion before the breast.
(<i>Burton</i>.)</p>

<p>Indicate outlines (an inverted V, thus ^),
with the forefingers touching
or crossed at the tips, the other fingers closed. (<i>Creel</i>; <i>Arapaho</i>
I.)</p>

<p>Both hands open, fingers upward, tips touching, brought downward,
and at same time separated to describe outline of a cone, suddenly
stopped. (<i>Cheyenne</i> II.)</p>

<p>Both hands approximated, held forward horizontally, fingers joined
and slightly arched, backs upward, withdraw them in a sideward and
downward direction, each hand moving to its corresponding side, thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page430" id="page430"></a>[pg 430]</span>
combinedly describing a hemisphere. Carry up the right and, with its
index pointing downward indicate a spiral line rising upward from the
center of the previously formed arch. (<i>Ojibwa</i> V.) "From the
dome-shaped form of the wigwam, and the smoke rising from the opening
in the roof."</p>

<p>Both hands flat and extended, placing the tips of the fingers of one
against those of the other, leaving the palms or wrists about four inches
apart. (<i>Absaroka</i> I; <i>Wyandot</i> I; <i>Shoshoni and Banak</i>
I.) "From its exterior outline."</p>

<p>Both hands carried to the front of the breast and placed V-shaped,
inverted, thus ^, with the palms, looking toward each other, edge of
fingers outward, thumbs inward. (<i>Dakota</i> I.) "From the outline of

<p>Place the tips of the fingers of both
hands together in front of the breast, with the wrists some distance
apart. (<i>Dakota</i> V.) Fig. 254.</p>

<p>Fingers of both hands extended and separated; then interlace them
so that the tips of the fingers of one hand protrude beyond the backs of
those of the opposing one; hold the hands in front of the breast, pointing
upward, leaving the wrists about six inches apart. (<i>Dakota</i> VII,
VIII;
<i>Hidatsa</i> I; <i>Ponka</i> II; <i>Arikara</i> I; <i>Pani</i> I.)</p>

<p>The extended hands, with finger tips upward and touching, the palms
facing one another, and the wrists about two inches apart, are held
before the chest. (<i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i> I.)</p>

<p>Place the tip of the index against the tip of the forefinger of the left
hand, the remaining fingers and thumbs closed, before the chest, leaving
the wrists about six inches apart. (<i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> III;
<i>Apache</i>
II; <i>Wichita</i> II.) "Outline of lodge." This is an abbreviated sign,
and care must be taken to distinguish it from <i>to meet</i>, in which the
fingers are brought from their respective sides instead of upward to form the
gesture.</p>

<p>Another: Both hands flat and extended, fingers slightly separated;
then place the fingers of the right hand between the fingers of the left
as far as the second joints, so that the fingers of
one hand protrude about an inch beyond those of
the other; the wrists must be held about six inches
apart. (<i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i> II;

<p>Fig. 256 represents a Sahaptin sign given to the

<p>Place the tips of the spread fingers of both hands against one another
pointing upward before the body, leaving a space of from four to six
inches between the wrists. Fig. 257.
The fingers are sometimes bent so as
to more nearly represent the outline of
a house and roof. Fig. 258. This,
however, is accidental. (<i>Pai-Ute</i> I.)

<p>Place both flat and extended hands in front of the shoulders, pointing
forward, palms facing; then pass them straight upward and slightly inward
near the termination of the gesture. This appears to combine the
gestures for <i>much</i>, <i>large</i>, and <i>lodge</i>. (<i>Arikara</i> I.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;, Coming or going out of a.</p>

<p>Same as the sign for <i>entering a lodge</i>, only the fingers of the right
hand point obliquely upward after passing under the left hand.
(<i>Dakota</i> I.) "Coming out from under cover."</p>

<p>Hold the open left hand a foot or eighteen inches in front of the
breast, palm downward or backward, fingers pointing toward the right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page432" id="page432"></a>[pg 432]</span>
and pass the right, back upward, with index extended, or all of the fingers
extended, and pointing forward, about eighteen inches forward underneath
the left through an arc from near the mouth. Some at the same
time move the left hand toward the breast. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;, Entering a.</p>

<p>The left hand is held with the back upward, and the right hand also
with the back up is passed in a curvilinear direction down under the
other, so as to rub against its palm, then up on the other side of it. The
left hand here represents the low door of the skin lodge and the right
the man stooping down to pass in, (<i>Long</i>.)</p>

<p>Pass the flat right hand in short curves under the left, which is held
a short distance forward. (<i>Wied</i>.) I have described the same sign. It
is not necessary to pass the hand more than once. By saying curves, he
seems to imply many passes. If the hand is passed more than once it
means repetition of the act. (<i>Matthews; McChesney</i>.) The conception
is
of the stooping to pass through the low entrance, which is often covered
by a flap of skin, sometimes stretched on a frame, and which must be
shoved aside, and the subsequent rising when the entrance has been
accomplished.
A distinction is reported by a correspondent as follows:
"If the intention is to speak of a person entering the gesturer's own
lodge, the right hand is passed under the left and toward the body, near
which the left hand is held; if of a person entering the lodge of another,
the left hand is held further from the body and the right is passed under
it and outward. In both cases both hands are slightly curved and
compressed."
As no such distinction is reported by others it may be an
individual invention or peculiarity.</p>

<p>A gliding movement of the extended hand, fingers joined, backs up,
downward, then ascending, indicative of the stooping and resumption
of the upright position in entering the same. (<i>Arapaho</i> I.)</p>

<p>(1) Sign for <span class="sc">Lodge</span>, the left hand being still in position used in making
sign for <span class="sc">Lodge</span>; (2) forefinger and thumb of right hand brought
to a point and thrust through the outline of an imaginary lodge represented
by the left hand. (<i>Cheyenne</i> II.)</p>

<p>First make the sign for <span class="sc">Lodge</span>, then place the left hand, horizontal
and slightly arched, before the body, and pass the right hand with extended
index underneath the left&mdash;forward and slightly upward beyond
it. (<i>Absaroka</i> I; <i>Dakota</i> V; <i>Shoshoni and Banak</i> I;
<i>Wyandot</i> I.)</p>

<p>Left hand (W), ends of fingers toward the right, stationary in front
of the left breast; pass the right hand directly and quickly out from
the breast under the stationary left hand, ending with the extended
fingers of the right hand pointing outward and slightly downward,
joined, palm downward flat, horizontal (W). (<i>Dakota</i> I.) "Gone under;
covered."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page433" id="page433"></a>[pg 433]</span>

<p>Hold the open left hand a foot or eighteen inches in front of the
breast, palm downward or backward, fingers pointing toward the right,
and pass the right hand, palm upward, fingers bent sidewise and
pointing backward, from before backward underneath it, through a
curve until near the mouth. Some at the same time move the left hand
a little forward. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.)</p>

<p>The left hand, palm downward, finger-tips forward, either quite extended
or with the fingers slightly bent, is held before the body. Then
the right hand nearly or quite extended, palm downward, finger-tips
near the left thumb, and pointing toward it, is passed transversely
under the left hand and one to four inches below it. The fingers of the
right hand point slightly upward when the motion is completed. This
sign usually, but not invariably, refers to entering a house. (<i>Mandan
and Hidatsa</i> I.)</p>

<p>Place the slightly curved left hand, palm down, before the breast,
pointing to the right, then pass the flat right hand, palm down, in a
short curve forward, under and upward beyond the left. (<i>Ute</i> I.)
"Evidently
from the manner in which a person is obliged to stoop in entering
an ordinary Indian lodge."</p>

<h5>HORSE.</h5>

<p>The right hand with the edge downward, the fingers joined, the
thumb recumbent, extended forward. (<i>Dunbar</i>.)</p>

<p>Place the index and middle finger of the right hand astraddle the
index finger of the left. [In the original the expression "third" finger
is used, but it is ascertained in another connection that the author counts
the thumb as the first finger and always means what is generally styled
middle finger when he says third. The alteration is made to prevent
confusion.]
(<i>Wied</i>.) I have described this sign in words to the same effect.
(<i>Matthews</i>.) The right arm is raised, and the hand, opened edgewise,
with
fingers parallel and approximated, is drawn from left to right before the
body at the supposed height of the animal. There is no conceivable
identity in the execution of this sign and <i>Wied's</i>, but his sign for
<i>horse</i> is
nearly identical with the sign for <i>ride a horse</i> among the Otos.
(<i>Boteler</i>.)
This sign is still used by the Cheyennes. (<i>Dodge</i>.)</p>

<p>A hand passed across the forehead. (<i>Macgowan</i>.)</p>

<p>Left-hand thumb and forefinger straightened out, held to the level of
and in front of the breast; right-hand forefinger separated from the
middle finger and thrown across the left hand to imitate the act of
bestriding. They appear to have no other conception of a horse, and
have thus indicated that they have known it only as an animal to be
ridden. (<i>Creel</i>; <i>Cheyenne</i> II.)</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page434" id="page434"></a>[pg 434]</span>

<p>Draw the right hand from left to right across the body about the
heart, the fingers all closed except the index. This is abbreviated by
making a circular sweep of the right open hand from about the left
elbow to the front of the body, probably indicating the mane. A Pani
sign. (<i>Cheyenne</i> IV.)</p>

<p>Place the first two fingers of the right hand, thumb extended (N 1),
downward, astraddle the first two joined and straight fingers of the
left hand (T 1), sidewise to the right. Many Sioux Indians use only the
forefinger straightened. (<i>Dakota</i> I.) "Horse mounted."</p>

<p>The first and second fingers extended and separated, remaining fingers
and thumb closed; left forefinger extended, horizontal, remaining fingers
and thumb closed; place the right-hand fingers astride of the forefinger
of the left, and both hands jerked together, up and down, to represent
the motion of a horse. (<i>Dakota</i> III.)</p>

<p>The two hands being clinched and near together, palms downward,
thumbs against the forefingers, throw them, each alternately, forward
and backward about a foot, through an ellipsis two or three times, from
about six inches in front of the chest, to imitate the galloping of a
horse,
or the hands may be held forward and not moved. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.)</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/fig260.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig260.png" alt="Horse. N.A. Indian" /></a>Fig. 260.</div>

<p>Place the extended and separated index and second fingers of the
right hand astraddle of the extended forefinger of the left.
Fig. 260. Sometimes all the fingers of the left hand are extended
in making this sign, as in Fig. 261, though this may
be the result of carelessness.
(<i>Dakota</i> VI, VII, VIII; <i>Hidatsa</i> I;
<i>Ponka</i> II; <i>Arikara</i> I; <i>Pani</i> I.)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/fig261.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig261.png" alt="Horse. Dakota" /></a>Fig. 261.</div>

<p>The left hand is before the chest, back upward in the position
of an index-hand pointing forward; then the first and second fingers
of the right hand only being extended, separated and pointing downward,
are set one on each side of the left forefinger, the interdigital
space resting on the forefinger. The palm faces downward and backward.
This represents a rider astride of a horse. (<i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i> I.)</p>

<p>Close hands, except forefingers, which are curved downward; move
them forward in rotation, imitating the fore feet of the horse, and make
puffing sound of "Uh, uh"! (<i>Omaha</i> I.) "This sign represents the
horse racing off to a safe distance, and puffing as he tosses his head."</p>

<p>The arm is flexed and the hand extended is brought on a level
with the mouth. The hand then assumes the position (W 1), modified
by being held edges up and down, palm toward the chest, instead of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page435" id="page435"></a>[pg 435]</span>
flat. The arm and hand being held thus about the usual height of a
horse are made to pass in an undulating manner across the face or body
about one foot distant from contact. The latter movements are to resemble
the animal's gait. (<i>Oto</i> I.) "Height of animal and movement of same."</p>

<p>The index and second fingers of the right hand are placed astraddle
the extended forefinger of the left. (<i>Wyandot</i> I.)</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/fig262.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig262.png" alt="Horse. Kaiowa, etc." /></a>Fig. 262.</div>

<p>Place the flat right hand, thumb down, edgewise before the right side

<p>Another: Hold the right hand flat, extended, with fingers
joined, the thumb extended upward,
then pass the hand at arm's length before the face from left to
right. This is said by the authorities cited below to be also the Caddo
sign, and that the other tribes mentioned originally obtained it from
that tribe. (<i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> I, III; <i>Apache</i> II;
<i>Wichita</i> II.) Fig. 263.</p>

<p>Another: Place the extended and separated index and second fingers
astraddle the extended and horizontal forefinger of the left hand. This
sign is only used when communicating with uninstructed white men, or
with other Indians whose sign for horse is specifically distinct.
(<i>Kaiowa</i>
I; <i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i> II; <i>Wichita</i> II.).</p>

<p>Place the extended index and second fingers of the right hand across
the extended first two fingers of the left. Fig. 264.
Size of the animal is indicated by passing the right hand, palm down,
with fingers loosely separated, forward from the right side, at any
height as the case may necessitate, after which the sign for <span class="sc">Horse</span> may
be made. (<i>Pima and Papago</i> I.)</p>

<p>Place the right hand, palm down, before the right side of the chest;
place the tips of the second and third fingers against the ball of the
thumb, allowing the index and little fingers to project
to represent the ears. Fig. 265. Frequently the middle
fingers extend equally with and against the thumb, forming
the head of the animal, the ears always being represented
by the two outer fingers, viz, the index and little
finger. Fig. 266. (<i>Ute</i> I.) A similar sign is reported
by Colonel Dodge as used by the Utes.</p>

<p>Elevate the right hand, extended, with fingers joined, outer edge
toward the ground, in front of the body or right shoulder, and pointing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page436" id="page436"></a>[pg 436]</span>
forward, resting the curved thumb against the palmar side of the index.
This sign appears also to signify <i>animal</i> generically, being
frequently
employed as a preliminary sign when denoting other species. (<i>Apache</i>
I.)</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute natural signs</i>:</p>

<p>Move the hands several times as if to hold the reins. (<i>Larson</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute signs</i>:</p>

<p>The French deaf-mutes add to the straddling of the index the motion
of a trot. American deaf-mutes indicate the ears by placing two fingers
of each hand on each side of the head and moving them backward and
forward. This is sometimes followed by straddling the left hand by the
fore and middle fingers of the right.</p>

<p>Hold the left hand, pointing forward, palm inward, a foot in front of

then obliquely along the left side. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;, Racing, Fast horse.</p>

<p>The right arm is elevated and bent at right angle before the face; the
hand, in position (S 1) modified by being horizontal, palm to the face,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page437" id="page437"></a>[pg 437]</span>
is drawn across edgewise in front of the face. The hand is then closed
and in position (B) approaches the mouth from which it is opened and
closed successively forward several times, finally it is suddenly thrust
out in position (W 1) back concave. (<i>Oto and Missouri</i> I.) "Is
expressed
in the (<i>Oto</i> I) sign for <span class="sc">Horse</span>, then the motion for quick running."</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Racing.</p>

<p>Extend the two forefingers and after placing them parallel near

about a foot. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.)</p>

<p>Place both hands, with the forefingers only extended and pointing
forward side by side with the palms down, before the body; then push
them alternately backward and forward, in imitation of the movement
of horses who are running "neck and neck." (<i>Ute</i> I; <i>Apache</i> I,

<p>&mdash;&mdash;, Saddling a.</p>

<p>Hold the left hand as in the sign for <span class="sc">Horse</span>, <i>Packing a</i>, and lay the

<p>Place the extended and separated fingers rapidly
with a slapping sound astraddle the extended fore
and second fingers of the left hand. The sound is
produced by the palm of the right hand which comes
in contact with the upper surface of the left. (<i>Ute</i> I.) Fig. 267.</p>

(<i>Dakota</i> IV.)</p>

<h5>KILL, KILLING.</h5>

<p>The hands are held with the edge upward, and the right hand strikes
the other transversely, as in the act of chopping. This sign seems to be
more particularly applicable to convey the idea of death produced by
a blow of the tomahawk or war-club. (<i>Long</i>.)</p>

<p>Clinch the hand and strike from above downward. (<i>Wied</i>.) I do not
remember this. I have given you the sign for killing with a stroke.
(<i>Matthews</i>.) There is an evident similarity in conception and
execution
between the (<i>Oto and Missouri</i> I) sign and <i>Wied's</i>.
(<i>Boteler</i>.) I have
frequently seen this sign made by the Arikara, Gros Ventre, and Mandan
Indians at Fort Berthold Agency. (<i>McChesney</i>.) This motion,
which maybe more clearly expressed as the downward thrust of a knife
held in the clinched hand, is still used by many tribes for the general
idea of "kill," and illustrates the antiquity of the knife as a weapon.
<i>Wied</i> does not say whether the clinched hand is thrust downward with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page438" id="page438"></a>[pg 438]</span>
the edge or the knuckles forward. The latter is now the almost universal
usage among the same tribes from which he is supposed to have
taken his list of signs, and indicates the thrust of a knife more
decisively
than if the fist were moved with the edge in advance. The actual employment
of arrow, gun, or club in taking life, is, however, often specified
by appropriate gesture.</p>

<p>Smite the sinister palm earthward with the dexter fist sharply, in sign
of "going down"; or strike out with the dexter fist toward the ground,
meaning to "shut down"; or pass the dexter under the left forefinger,
meaning to "go under." (<i>Burton</i>.)</p>

<p>Right hand cast down. (<i>Macgowan</i>.)</p>

<p>Hold the right fist, palm down, knuckles forward, and make a thrust
forward and downward. (<i>Arapaho</i>
II; <i>Cheyenne</i> V; <i>Dakota</i> VI, VII,
VIII; <i>Hidatsa</i> I; <i>Ponka</i> II; <i>Arikara</i>
I; <i>Pani</i> I.) Fig. 268.</p>

<p>Right hand clinched, thumb lying
along the finger tips, elevated to near the shoulder,
strike downward and out vaguely in the direction of
the object to be killed. The abstract sign for <i>kill</i> is simply
to clinch the right hand in the manner described and
strike it down and out from the right side. (<i>Cheyenne</i> II.)</p>

<p>Close the right hand, extending the forefinger alone;
point toward the breast, then throw from you forward, bringing the hand
toward the ground. (<i>Ojibwa</i> V; <i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>Both hands clinched, with the thumbs resting against the middle joints
of the forefingers, hold the left transversely in front of and as high as
the breast, then push the right, palm down, quickly over and down in front
of the left. (<i>Absaroka</i> I; <i>Shoshoni and Banak</i> I.) "To force
under&mdash;literally."</p>

<p>With the dexter fist carried to the front of the body at the right side,
strike downward and outward several times, with back of hand upward,
thumb toward the left, several times. (<i>Dakota</i> I.) "Strike down."</p>

<p>With the first and second joints of the fingers of the right hand bent,
end of thumb against the middle of the index, palm downward, move
the hand energetically forward and downward from a foot in front of the
right breast. Striking with a stone&mdash;man's first weapon. (<i>Dakota</i>,
IV.)</p>

<p>The left hand, thumb up, back forward, not very rigidly extended, is
held before the chest and struck in the palm with the outer edge of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page439" id="page439"></a>[pg 439]</span>
right hand. (<i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i> I.) "To kill with a blow; to deal
the death blow." Fig. 269.</p>

<p>Right hand, fingers open but slightly curved, palm to the left; move
downward, describing a curve. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>Another: Similar to the last, but the index
finger is extended, pointing in front of
you, the other fingers but half open.
(<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>Place the flat right hand, palm down, at
arm's length to the right, bring it quickly,
horizontally, to the side of the head, then
make the sign for <span class="sc">Dead</span>. (<i>Ojibwa</i> V; <i>Wyandot</i>
I.) "To strike with a club, dead."</p>

<p>Both hands, in positions (AA), with arms semiflexed toward the body,
make the forward rotary sign with the clinched fists as in fighting; the
right hand is then raised from the left outward, as clutching a knife
with the blade pointing downward and inward toward the left fist; the
left fist, being held <i>in situ</i>, is struck now by the right, edgewise
as above
described, and both suddenly fall together. (<i>Oto and Missouri</i> I.)
"To
strike down in battle with a knife. Indians seldom disagree or kill

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page440" id="page440"></a>[pg 440]</span>
back of the fingers of the right hand into the slightly curved palm of
the left, immediately afterward throwing the right outward and downward
toward the right. (<i>Ute</i> I.) "Killed and falling over."</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; You; I will kill you.</p>

<p>Direct the right hand toward the offender and spring the finger from
the thumb, as in the act of sprinkling water. (<i>Long</i>.) The conception
is perhaps "causing blood to flow," or, perhaps, "sputtering away the
life," though there is a strong similarity to the motion used for the
<i>discharge of a gun or arrow</i>.</p>

on pages <a href="#page377">377</a> and <a href="#page378">378</a>, <i>supra</i>.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;, to, with a knife.</p>

<p>Clinch the right hand and strike forcibly toward the ground before
the breast from the height of the face. (<i>Ute</i> I.) "Appears to have
originated when flint knives were still used."</p>

<h5>NO, NOT. (Compare <span class="sc">Nothing</span>.)</h5>

<p>The hand held up before the face, with the palm outward and vibrated
to and fro. (<i>Dunbar</i>.)</p>

<p>The right hand waved outward to the right with the thumb upward.
(<i>Long</i>; <i>Creel</i>.)</p>

<p>Wave the right hand quickly by and in front of the face toward the
right. (<i>Wied</i>.) Refusing to accept the idea or statement presented.</p>

<p>Move the hand from right to left, as if motioning away. This sign
also means "I'll have nothing to do with you." (<i>Burton</i>.)</p>

<p>A deprecatory wave of the right hand from front to right, fingers
extended and joined. (<i>Arapaho</i> I; <i>Cheyenne</i> V.)</p>

<p>Right-hand fingers extended together, side of hand in front of and
facing the face, in front of the mouth and waved suddenly to the right.
(<i>Cheyenne</i> II.)</p>

<p>Place the right hand extended before the body, fingers pointing upward,
palm to the front, then throw the hand outward to the right, and
slightly downward. (<i>Absaroka</i> I; <i>Hidatsa</i> I; <i>Arikara</i> I.)
See Fig. 65, page <a href="#page290">290</a>.</p>

<p>The right hand, horizontal, palm toward the left, is pushed sidewise
outward and toward the right from in front of the left breast. <i>No,
none, I have none</i>, etc., are all expressed by this sign. Often these
Indians
for <i>no</i> will simply shake the head to the right and left. This
sign, although it may have originally been introduced from the white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page441" id="page441"></a>[pg 441]</span>
people's habit of shaking the head to express "no," has been in use among
them for as long as the oldest people can remember, yet they do not use
the variant to express "yes." (<i>Dakota</i> I.) "Dismissing the idea,
etc."</p>

<p>Place the opened relaxed right hand, pointing toward the left, back
forward, in front of the nose or as low as the breast, and throw it forward
and outward about eighteen inches. Some at the same time turn
the palm upward. Or make the sign at the height of the breast with
both hands. Represents the shaking of the head. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.) The
shaking of the head in negation is not so universal or "natural" as is
popularly supposed, for the ancient Greeks, followed by the modern
Turks and rustic Italians, threw the head back, instead of shaking it,
for "no." Rabelais makes Pantagruel (Book 3) show by many quotations
from the ancients how the shaking of the head was a frequent if not
universal concomitant of oracular utterance&mdash;not connected with negation.</p>

<p>Hold the flat hand edgewise, pointing upward before the right side of
the chest, then throw it outward and
downward to the right. (<i>Dakota</i> VI, VII.) Fig. 270.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/fig270.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig270.png" alt="Negation. No. Dakota" /></a>Fig. 270.</div>

<p>The hand, extended or slightly curved, is held in front of the body a
little to the right of the median line; it is then carried with a rapid sweep
a foot or more farther to the right. (<i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i> I.)</p>

<p>Place the hand as in <i>yes</i>, as follows: The hand open, palm downward,
at the level of the breast, is moved forward with a quick downward
motion from the wrist, imitating
a bow of the head; then move it from side to side. (<i>Iroquois</i> I.)
"A shake of the head."</p>

<p>Throw the flat right hand forward and outward to the right, palm to
the front. (<i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i> II;
<i>Wichita</i> II.)</p>

<p>Quick motion of open hand from the mouth forward, palm toward the
mouth. (<i>Sahaptin</i> I.)</p>

<p>Place hand in front of body, fingers relaxed, palm toward body (Y 1),
then with easy motion move to a point, say, a foot from the body, a little
to right, fingers same, but palm upward. (<i>Sahaptin</i> I.) "We don't
agree." To express <i>All gone</i>, use a similar motion with both hands.
"Empty."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page442" id="page442"></a>[pg 442]</span>

<p>The hand waved outward with the thumb upward in a semi-curve.
(<i>Comanche</i> I; <i>Wichita</i> I.)</p>

<p>Elevate the extended index and wave it quickly from side to side
before the face. This is sometimes accompanied by shaking
the head. (<i>Pai-Ute</i> I.) Fig. 271.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:20%;"><a href="images/fig271.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig271.png" alt="Negation. No. Pai-Ute" /></a>Fig. 271.</div>

<p>Extend the index, holding it vertically before the face,
remaining fingers and thumb closed; pass the finger
quickly from side to side a foot or so before the face.
(<i>Apache</i> I.) This sign, as also that of (<i>Pai-Ute</i> I), is
substantially
the same as that with the same significance
reported from Naples by De Jorio.</p>

<p>Another: The right hand, naturally relaxed, is thrown
outward and forward toward the right. (<i>Apache</i> I.)</p>

<p>Wave extended index before the face from side to side. (<i>Apache</i> III.)</p>

<p>Another: Wave the index briskly before the right shoulder. This
appears to be more common than the preceding. (<i>Apache</i> III.)</p>

<p>Right hand extended at the height of the eye, palm outward, then
moved outward a little toward the right. (<i>Kutchin</i> I.)</p>

<p>Extend the palm of the right hand horizontally a foot from the waist,
palm downward, then suddenly throw it half over from the body, as if
tossing a chip from the back of the hand. (<i>Wichita</i> I.)</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute natural signs</i>:</p>

<p>Shake the head. (<i>Ballard.</i>)</p>

<p>Move both hands from each other, and, at the same time, shake the
head. (<i>Hasenstab.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute signs</i>:</p>

<p>French deaf-mutes wave the hand to the right and downward, with
the first and second fingers joined and extended, the other fingers closed.
This position of the fingers is that for the letter N in the finger
alphabet,
the initial for the word <i>non</i>. American deaf-mutes for emphatic
negative wave the right hand before the face.</p>

<p><i>Turkish sign</i>:</p>

<p>Throwing head back or elevating the chin and partly shutting the
eyes. This also means, "Be silent." (<i>Barnum.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Japanese sign</i>:</p>

<p>Move the right hand rapidly back and forth before the face. Communicated
in a letter from Prof. <span class="sc">E.S. Morse</span>, late of the University of
Tokio, Japan. The same correspondent mentions that the Admiralty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page443" id="page443"></a>[pg 443]</span>
Islanders pass the forefinger across the face, striking the nose in
passing,
for negation. If the <i>no</i> is a doubtful one they <i>rub</i> the nose
in passing, a gesture common elsewhere.</p>

<h5>NONE, NOTHING; I HAVE NONE.</h5>

<p>Motion of rubbing out. (<i>Macgowan</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Little</i> or <i>nothing</i> is signified by passing one hand over the
other. (<i>Creel</i>; <i>Ojibwa</i> I.)</p>

<p>May be signified by smartly brushing the right hand across the left
from the wrist toward the fingers, both hands extended, palms toward
each other and fingers joined. (<i>Arapaho</i> I.)</p>

<p>Is included in <i>gone, destroyed. (Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<p>Place the open left hand about a foot in front of the navel, pointing
obliquely forward toward the right, palm obliquely upward and
backward, and sweep the palm of the open right hand over it and about
a foot forward and to the right through a curve. All bare. (<i>Dakota</i>
IV.)</p>

<p>Another: Pass the ulnar side of the right index along the left index
several times from tip to base, while pronating and supinating the latter.
Some roll the right index over on its back as they move it along the
left. The hands are to be in front of the navel, backs forward and outward,
the left index straight and pointing forward toward the right, the
right index straight and pointing forward and toward the left; the other
fingers loosely closed. Represents a bush bare of limbs. (<i>Dakota</i>
IV.)</p>

<p>Another: With the light hand pointing obliquely forward to the left,
the left forward to the right, palms upward, move
them alternately several times up and down,
each time striking the ends of the fingers. Or,
the left hand being in the above position, rub
the right palm in a circle on the left two or three
times, and then move it forward and to the right.
Rubbed out; that is all; it is all gone. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.)</p>

<p>Pass the palm of the flat right hand over
the left from the wrist toward and off of the tips
of the fingers. (<i>Dakota</i> VI, VII, VIII; <i>Ponka</i> II; <i>Pani</i>
I.) Fig. 272.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/fig272.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig272.png" alt="None. Dakota" /></a>Fig. 272.</div>

<p>Brush the palm of the left hand from wrist to finger tips with the
palm of the right. (<i>Wyandot</i> I.)</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page444" id="page444"></a>[pg 444]</span>

<p>Another: Throw both hands outward toward their respective sides
from the breast. (<i>Wyandot</i> I.)</p>

<p>Pass the flat right palm over the palm of the left hand from the wrist
forward over the fingers. (<i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> III;
<i>Apache</i> II; <i>Wichita</i> II.) "Wiped out."</p>

<p>Hold the left hand open, with the palm upward, at the height of the
elbow and before the body; pass the right quickly over the left, palms
touching, from the wrist toward the tips of the left, as if brushing off
dust. (<i>Apache</i> I.)</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute natural signs</i>:</p>

<p>Place the hands near each other, palms downward, and move them
over and apart, bringing the palms upward in opposite directions.
(<i>Ballard</i>.)</p>

<p>Make a motion as in picking up something between the thumb and
finger, carry it to the lips, blow it away, and show the open hand.
(<i>Wing</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Australian sign</i>:</p>

<p><i>Pannie</i> (none or nothing). For instance, a native says <i>Bomako
ingina</i> (give a tomahawk). I reply by shaking the hand,
thumb, and all fingers, separated and loosely extended,
palm down. (<i>Smyth</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>) Fig. 273.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:25%;"><a href="images/fig273.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig273.png" alt="None. Australian" /></a>Fig. 273.</div>

<p><i>Turkish sign</i>:</p>

<p>Blowing across open palm as though blowing off feathers; also means
"Nothing, nothing left." (<i>Barnum</i>.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;, I have none.</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute natural signs</i>:</p>

<p>Expressed by the signs for none, after pointing to one's self.
(<i>Ballard</i>.)</p>

<p>Stretch the tongue and move it to and fro like a pendulum, then
shake the head as if to say "no." (<i>Ziegler</i>.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Left. Exhausted for the present.</p>

<p>Hold both hands naturally relaxed nearly at arm's length before the
body, palms toward the face, move them alternately to and fro a few
inches, allowing the fingers to strike those of the opposite hand each
time as far as the second joint. (<i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> III;
<i>Apache</i> II; <i>Wichita</i> II.) Cleaned out.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page445" id="page445"></a>[pg 445]</span>

<h5>QUANTITY, LARGE; MANY; MUCH.</h5>

<p>The flat of the right hand patting the back of the left hand, which is
repeated in proportion to the greater or lesser quantity. (<i>Dunbar</i>.)
Simple repetition.</p>

<p>The hands and arms are passed in a curvilinear direction outward and
downward, as if showing the form of a large globe; then the hands are
closed and elevated, as if something was grasped in each hand and held
up about as high as the face. (<i>Long</i>; <i>Creel</i>.)</p>

<p>Clutch at the air several times with both hands. The motion greatly
resembles those of danseuses playing the castanets. (<i>Ojibwa</i> I.)</p>

<p>In the preceding signs the authorities have not distinguished between
the ideas of "many" and "much." In the following there appears by
the expressions of the authorities to be some distinction intended between
a number of objects and a quantity in volume.</p>

<h5>&mdash;&mdash; MANY.</h5>

<p>A simultaneous movement of both hands, as if gathering or heaping
up. (<i>Arapaho</i> I.) Literally "a heap."</p>

<p>Both hands, with spread and slightly curved fingers, are held pendent
about two feet apart before the thighs; then draw them toward one
another, horizontally, drawing them upward as they come together.
(<i>Absaroka</i> I; <i>Shoshoni and Banak</i> I; <i>Kaiowa</i> I;
<i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i>
II; <i>Wichita</i> II.) "An accumulation of objects."</p>

<p>Hands about eighteen inches from the ground in front and about the
same distance apart, held scoop-fashion, palms looting toward each
other, fingers separated; then, with a diving motion, as if scooping
up corn from the ground, bring the hands nearly together, with fingers
nearly closed, as though holding the corn, and carry upward to the
height of the breast, where the hands are turned over, fingers pointing
downward, separated, as though the contents were allowed to drop to
the ground. (<i>Dakota</i> I, II.)</p>

<p>Open the fingers of both hands, and hold the two hands before the
breast, with the fingers upward and a little apart, and the palms turned
toward each other, as if grasping a number of things. (<i>Iroquois</i> I.)</p>

<p>Place the hands on either side of and as high as the head, then open
and close the fingers rapidly four or five times. (<i>Wyandot</i> I.)
"Counting 'tens' an indefinite number of times."</p>

<p>Clasp the hands effusively before the breast. (<i>Apache</i> III.)</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute natural signs</i>;</p>

<p>Put the fingers of the two hands together, tip to tip, and rub them
with a rapid motion. (<i>Ballard</i>.)</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page446" id="page446"></a>[pg 446]</span>

<p>Make a rapid movement of the fingers and thumbs of both hands
upward and downward, and at the same time cause both lips to touch
each other in rapid succession, and both eyes to be half opened.
(<i>Hasenstab</i>.)</p>

<p>Move the fingers of both hands forward and backward. (<i>Ziegler</i>.)
Add to <i>Ziegler's</i> sign: slightly opening and closing the hands.
(<i>Wing</i>.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Horses.</p>

<p>Raise the right arm above the head, palm forward, and thrust forward
forcibly on a line with the shoulder. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Persons, etc.</p>

<p>Hands and fingers interlaced. (<i>Macgowan</i>.)</p>

<p>Take up a bunch of grass or a clod of earth; place it in the hand of
the person addressed, who looks down upon it. (<i>Omaha</i> I.) "Represents
as many or more than the particles contained in the mass."</p>

<h5>&mdash;&mdash; MUCH.</h5>

<p>Move both hands toward one another and slightly upward. (<i>Wied</i>.)
I have seen this sign, but I think it is used only for articles that may be
piled on the ground or formed into a heap. The sign most in use for the
general idea of <i>much</i> or <i>many</i> I have given. (<i>Matthews</i>.)</p>

<p>Bring the hands up in front of the body with the fingers carefully
kept distinct. (<i>Cheyenne</i> I.)</p>

<p>Both hands closed, brought up in a curved motion toward each other
to the level of the neck or chin, (<i>Cheyenne</i> II.)</p>

<p>Both hands and arms are partly extended; each hand is then made to
describe, simultaneously with the other, from the head downward, the
arc of a circle curving outward. This is used for <i>large</i> in some
senses. (<i>Ojibwa</i> V; <i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i> I.)</p>

<p>Both hands flat and extended, placed before the breast, finger tips
touching, palms down; then separate them by passing outward and
downward as if smoothing the outer surface of a globe. (<i>Absaroka</i> I;
<i>Shoshoni and Banack</i> I; <i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> III;
<i>Apache</i> II; <i>Wichita</i> II.) "A heap."</p>

<p><i>Much</i> is included in <i>many</i> or <i>big</i>, as the case may
require. (<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<p>The hands, with fingers widely separated, slightly bent, pointing forward,
and backs outward, are to be rapidly approximated through downward
curves, from positions twelve to thirty-six inches apart, at the
height of the navel, and quickly closed. Or the hands may be moved
until the right is above the left. So much that it has to be gathered
with both hands. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.)</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page447" id="page447"></a>[pg 447]</span>

<p>Hands open, palms turned in, held about three feet apart and about
two feet from the ground. Raise them about a foot, then bring in an
upward curve toward each other. As they pass each other, palms down,
the right hand is about three inches above the left. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>Place both hands flat and extended, thumbs touching, palms downward,
in front of and as high as the face; then move them outward and
downward a short distance toward their respective sides, thus describing
the upper half of a circle. (<i>Wyandot</i> I.) "A heap."</p>

<p>Both hands clinched, placed as high as and in front of the hips, palms
facing opposite sides and about
a foot apart, then bring them upward
and inward, describing an
arc, until the thumbs touch.
(<i>Apache</i> I.) Fig. 274.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:55%;"><a href="images/fig274.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig274.png" alt="Much, quantity. Apache" /></a>Fig. 274.</div>

<p>Sweep out both hands as if inclosing
a large object; wave the
hands forward and somewhat upward. (<i>Apache</i> III.) "Suggesting
immensity."</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute sign</i>:</p>

<p>The French deaf-mutes place the two hands, with fingers united and
extended in a slight curve, nearly together, left above right, in front of
the body, and then raise the left in a direct line above the right, thus
suggesting the idea of a large and slightly-rounded object being held
between the two palms.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; And heavy.</p>

<p>Hands open, palms turned in, held about three feet apart, and about
two feet from the ground, raise them about a foot; close the fists, backs
of hands down, as if lifting something heavy; then move a short distance
up and down several times. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>Remarks connected with the signs for <i>quantity</i> appear on pages <a href="#page291">291</a>,
<a href="#page359">359</a>, and <a href="#page382">382</a>, <i>supra</i>.</p>

<h5>QUESTION; INQUIRY; INTERROGATION.</h5>

<p>The palm of the hand upward and carried circularly outward, and
depressed. (<i>Dunbar</i>.)</p>

<p>The hand held up with the thumb near the face, and the palm directed
toward the person of whom the inquiry is made; then rotated upon
the wrist two or three times edgewise, to denote uncertainty. (<i>Long;
Comanche</i> I; <i>Wichita</i> I.) The motion might be mistaken for the
derisive,
vulgar gesture called "taking a sight," "<i>donner un pied de nez</i>,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page448" id="page448"></a>[pg 448]</span>
descending to our small boys from antiquity. The separate motion of the
fingers in the vulgar gesture as used in our eastern cities is, however,
more nearly correlated with some of the Indian signs for <i>fool</i>, one
of which is the same as that for <i>Kaiowa</i>, see <span class="sc">Tribal Signs</span>. It may be
noted that the Latin "<i>sagax</i>," from which is derived "sagacity," was
chiefly used to denote the keen scent of dogs, so there is a relation
established between the nasal organ and wisdom or its absence, and that
"<i>suspendere naso</i>" was a classic phrase for hoaxing. The Italian
expressions
"<i>restare con un palmo di naso</i>," "<i>con tanto di naso</i>," etc.,
mentioned by the canon De Jorio, refer to the same vulgar gesture in
which the face is supposed to be thrust forward sillily. Further remarks
connected with this sign appear on pp. <a href="#page304">304</a>, <a href="#page305">305</a>, <i>supra</i>.</p>

<p>Extend the open hand perpendicularly with the palm outward, and
move it from side to side several times. (<i>Wied</i>.) This sign is still
used. For "outward," however, I would substitute "forward." The
hand is usually, but not always, held before the face. (<i>Matthews</i>.)
This is not the sign for <i>question</i>, but is used to attract attention
before commencing a conversation or any other time during the talk, when
found necessary. (<i>McChesney</i>.) With due deference to Dr. McChesney,
this is the sign for <i>question</i>, as used by many tribes, and
especially Dakotas.
The Prince of Wied probably intended to convey the motion of
<i>forward, to the front</i>, when he said <i>outward</i>. In making the
sign for
<i>attention</i> the hand is held more nearly horizontal, and is directed
toward the individual whose attention is desired. (<i>Hoffman</i>.)</p>

<p>Right hand in front of right side of body, forearm horizontal, palm
of hand to the left, fingers extended, joined and horizontal, thumb
extending upward naturally, turn hand to the left about 60&#176;, then resume
first position. Continue this motion for about two to four seconds,
depending on earnestness of inquiry. (<i>Creel</i>.)</p>

<p>Right hand, fingers pointing upward, palm outward, elevated to the
level of the shoulder, extended toward the person addressed, and slightly
shaken from side to side. (<i>Cheyenne</i> II.)</p>

<p>Hold the elbow of the right arm against the side, extending the right
hand, palm inward, with all the fingers straight joined, as far as may
be, while the elbow remains fixed against the side; then turn the extended
hand to the right and left, repeating this movement several
times, being performed by the muscles of the arm. (<i>Sac, Fox, and
Kickapoo</i> I.)</p>

<p>Place the flat and extended right hand, palm forward, about twelve
inches in front of and as high as the shoulder, then shake the hand from
side to side as it is moved upward and forward. (<i>Apache</i> I.) See Fig.
304, in <span class="sc">Tendoy-Huerito Dialogue</span>, p. <a href="#page486">486</a>. This may be compared
with the ancient Greek sign, Fig. 67, and with the modern Neapolitan
sign, Fig. 70, both of which are discussed on p. <a href="#page291">291</a>, <i>supra</i>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page449" id="page449"></a>[pg 449]</span>

<p><i>Deaf-mute natural sign</i>:</p>

<p>A quick motion of the lips with an inquiring look. (<i>Ballard</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute sign</i>:</p>

<p>The French deaf-mutes for <i>inquiry</i>, "<i>qu'est-ce que c'est</i>?" bring the
hands to the lower part of the chest, with open palms about a foot
separate and diverging outward.</p>

<p><i>Australian sign</i>:</p>

<p>One is a sort of note of interrogation. For instance, if I were to
meet a native and make the sign: Hand flat, fingers and thumb extended,
the two middle fingers touching, the two
outer slightly separated from the middle by turning
the hand palm upward as I met him, it would
mean: "Where are you going?" In other words
I should say "<i>Minna</i>?" (what name?). (<i>Smyth</i>.) Fig. 275.</p>

<p>The upright nearly closed hands, thumbs against the middle of the
forefingers, being in front of the body, with their thumbs near together,

line. All in a line in front. (<i>Cheyenne</i> III; <i>Dakota</i> IV.)</p>

<p>Pass each hand down the outer seam of the pants. (<i>Sac, Fox, and

<p>Sign for <span class="sc">White Man</span> as follows: The extended index (M turned inward)
is drawn from the left side of the head around in front to the
right side, about on a line with the brim of the hat, with the back of
the hand outward; and then for <span class="sc">Fort</span>, viz, on level of the breasts in
front of body, both hands with fingers turned inward, straight, backs
joined, backs of hands outward, horizontal, turn outward the hands
until the fingers are free, curve them, and bring the wrists together so
as to describe a circle with a space left between the ends of the curved
fingers. (<i>Dakota</i> I.) "From his fortified place of abode."</p>

<p>Another: Both hands in front of body, fists, backs outward, hands in
contact, draw them apart on a straight line right to right, left to left
about two feet, then draw the index, other fingers closed, across the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page450" id="page450"></a>[pg 450]</span>
forehead above the eyebrows. This is the sign preferred by the Sioux.
(<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<p>Extend the fingers of the right hand; place the thumb on the same
plane close beside them, and then bring the thumb side of the hand
horizontally against the middle of the forehead, palm downward and
little finger to the front. (<i>Dakota</i> II; <i>Ute</i> I.) "Visor of
forage cap."</p>

<p>First make the sign for <span class="sc">Soldier</span> substantially the same as (<i>Dakota</i>
VI) below, then that for <span class="sc">White Man</span>, viz.: Draw the opened right hand
horizontally
from left to right across the forehead a little above the eyebrows,
the back of the hand to be upward and the fingers pointing toward the
left; or, close all the fingers except the index and draw it across the
forehead in the same manner. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.) For illustrations of other
signs for white man see Figs 315 and 329, <i>infra</i>.</p>

<p>Place the radial sides of the clinched hands together before the chest,
then draw them horizontally apart. (<i>Dakota</i>
VI; <i>Arikara</i> I.) "All in a line." Fig. 276.</p>

<p>Put thumbs to temples, and forefingers forward, meeting in front, other
fingers closed. (<i>Apache</i> III.) "Cap-visor."</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;, Arikara.</p>

<p>Make the sign for <span class="sc">Arikara</span> (see <span class="sc">Tribal Signs</span>) and that for <span class="sc">Brave</span>.
(<i>Arikara</i> I.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;, Dakota.</p>

<p>Make the sign for <span class="sc">Dakota</span> (see <span class="sc">Tribal Signs</span>) and that for <span class="sc">Soldier</span>.
(<i>Dakota</i> VI.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;, Indian.</p>

<p>Both fists before the body, palms down, thumbs touching, then draw
them horizontally apart to the right and left. (<i>Arapaho</i> II;
<i>Cheyenne</i> V;
<i>Ponka</i> II; <i>Pani</i> I.) This is the same sign illustrated in Fig.
276, above,
as given by tribes there cited for <i>white</i> or <i>American</i> soldier.
The
tribes now cited use it for <i>a soldier</i> of the same tribe as the
gesturer, or
perhaps for <i>soldier</i> generically, as they subjoin a tribal sign or
the sign
for <i>white man</i>, when desiring to refer to any other than their own
tribe.</p>

<h5>TRADE or BARTER; EXCHANGE.</h5>

<h5>&mdash;&mdash; TRADE.</h5>

<p>First make the sign of <span class="sc">Exchange</span> (see below), then pat the left arm
with the right finger, with a rapid motion from the hand passing it
toward the shoulder. (<i>Long</i>.)</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page451" id="page451"></a>[pg 451]</span>

<p>Strike the extended index finger of the right hand several times upon
that of the left. (<i>Wied</i>.) I have described the same sign in
different
terms and at greater length. It is only necessary, however, to place
the fingers in contact once. The person whom the prince saw making
this sign may have meant to indicate something more than the simple
idea of trade, <i>i.e.</i>, trade often or habitually. The idea of
frequency is
often conveyed by the repetition of a sign (as in some Indian languages
by repetition of the root). Or the sign-maker may have repeated the
sign to demonstrate it more clearly. (<i>Matthews</i>.) Though some
difference
exists in the motions executed in <i>Wied's</i> sign and that of (<i>Oto
and Missouri</i> I), there is sufficient similarity to justify a probable
identity
of conception and to make them easily understood. (<i>Boteler</i>.) In the
author's mind <i>exchange</i> was probably intended for one transaction, in
which each of two articles took the place before occupied by the other,
and <i>trade</i> was intended for a more general and systematic barter,
indicated
by the repetition of strokes. Such distinction would not perhaps
have occurred to most observers, but as the older authorities, such as
Long and Wied, give distinct signs under the separate titles of
<i>trade</i> and
<i>exchange</i> they must be credited with having some reason for so doing.
A pictograph connected with this sign is shown on page <a href="#page381">381</a>, <i>supra</i>.</p>

<p>Cross the forefingers of both hands before the breast. (<i>Burton</i>.)
"Diamond cut diamond." This conception of one smart trader cutting
into the profits of another is a mistake arising from the rough resemblance
of the sign to that for <i>cutting</i>. Captain Burton is right, however,
in reporting that this sign for <i>trade</i> is also used for <i>white man</i>,
<i>American</i>, and that the same Indians using it orally call white men
"shwop," from the English or American word "swap" or "swop." This
is a legacy from the early traders, the first white men met by the Western
tribes, and the expression extends even to the Sahaptins on the
Yakama River, where it appears incorporated in their language as
<i>swiapoin</i>. It must have penetrated to them through the Shoshoni.</p>

<p>Cross the index fingers. (<i>Macgowan</i>.)</p>

<p>Cross the forefingers at right angles. (<i>Arapaho</i> I.)</p>

<p>Both hands, palms facing each other, forefingers extended, crossed
right above left before the breast. (<i>Cheyenne</i> II.)</p>

<p>The left hand, with forefinger extended, pointing toward the right
(rest of fingers closed), horizontal, back outward, otherwise as (M), is
held in front of left breast about a foot; and the right hand, with
forefinger
extended (J), in front of and near the right breast, is carried outward
and struck over the top of the stationary left (+) crosswise, where
it remains for a moment. (<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<p>Hold the extended left index about a foot in front of the breast, pointing
obliquely forward toward the right, and lay the extended right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page452" id="page452"></a>[pg 452]</span>
index at right angles across the left, first raising the right about a foot
above the left, palms of both inward, other fingers half closed. This
is also an Arapaho sign as well as Dakota. Yours is there and mine is
there; take either. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.)</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:45%;"><a href="images/fig277.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig277.png" alt="Trade. Dakota" /></a>Fig. 277.</div>

<p>Place the first two fingers of the right hand across those of the left,
both being slightly spread. The hands
are sometimes used, but are placed
edgewise. (<i>Dakota</i> V.) Fig. 277.</p>

<p>Another: The index of the right hand
is laid across the forefinger of the left when the transaction includes but
two persons trading single article for article. (<i>Dakota</i> V.)</p>

<p>Strike the back of the extended index at a right angle against the
radial side of the extended forefinger of
the left hand. (<i>Dakota</i> VI, VII.) Fig.
278.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:45%;"><a href="images/fig278.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig278.png" alt="Trade. Dakota" /></a>Fig. 278.</div>

<p>The forefingers are extended, held obliquely
upward, and crossed at right angles
to one another, usually in front of the chest. (<i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i>
I.)</p>

<p>Bring each hand as high as the breast, forefinger pointing up, the
other fingers closed, then move quickly the right hand to the left, the
left to the right, the forefingers making an acute angle as they cross.
(<i>Omaha</i> I; <i>Ponka</i> I.)</p>

<p>The palm point of the right index extended touches the chest; it is
then turned toward the second individual interested, then touches the
object. The arms are now drawn toward the body, semiflexed, with the
hands, in type-positions (W W), crossed, the right superposed to the
left. The individual then casts an interrogating glance at the second
person. (<i>Oto and Missouri</i> I.) "To cross something from one to
another."</p>

<p>Close the hands, except the index fingers and the thumbs; with them
open, move the hands several times past one another at the height of
the breast; the index fingers pointing upward and the thumbs outward.
(<i>Iroquois</i> I.) "The movement indicates 'exchanging.'"</p>

<p>Hold the left hand horizontally before the body, with the forefinger
only extended and pointing to the right, palm downward; then, with
the right hand closed, index only extended, palm to the right, place the
index at right angles on the forefinger of the left, touching at the second
joints. (<i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i> II;
<i>Wichita</i> II.)</p>

<p>Pass the hands in front of the body, all the fingers closed except the
forefingers. (<i>Sahaptin</i> I.)</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page453" id="page453"></a>[pg 453]</span>

<p>Close the fingers of both hands (K); bring them opposite each
shoulder; then bring the hands across each other's pathway, without
permitting them to touch. At the close of the sign the left hand will be
near and pointing at the right shoulder; right hand will be near and
pointing at the left shoulder. (<i>Comanche</i> I.)</p>

<p>Close both hands, leaving the forefingers only extended; place the
right before and several inches above the left, then pass the right hand
toward the left elbow and the left hand toward the right elbow, each
hand following the course made by a flourishing cut with a short sword.
This sign, according to the informant, is also employed by the Banak
and Umatilla Indians. (<i>Comanche</i> II; <i>Pai-Ute</i> I.)</p>

<p>The forefingers of both hands only extended, pass the left from left to
right, and the right at the same time crossing its course from the tip
toward the wrist of the left, stopping when the wrists cross. (<i>Ute</i>
I.) "Exchange of articles."</p>

<p>Right hand carried across chest, hand extended, palm upward, fingers
and thumb closed as if holding something; left hand, in same position,
carried across the right, palm downward. (<i>Kutchin</i> I.)</p>

<p>Hands pronated and forefingers crossed. (<i>Zun&#x0304;i</i> I.)</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute natural sign</i>:</p>

<p>Close the hand slightly, as if taking something, and move it forward
and open the hand as if to drop or give away the thing, and again close
and withdraw the hand as if to take something else. (<i>Bollard</i>.)</p>

<p>American instructed deaf-mutes use substantially the sign described
by (<i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i> I).</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; To buy.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/fig279.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig279.png" alt="Buy. Ute" /></a>Fig. 279.</div>

<p>Hold the left hand about twelve inches before the breast, the thumb
resting on the closed third and fourth
fingers; the fore and second fingers
separated and extended, palm toward
the breast; then pass the extended
index into the crotch formed by the
separated fingers of the left hand. This
is an invented sign, and was given to illustrate the difference between
buying and trading. (<i>Ute</i> I.) Fig. 279.</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute natural sign</i>:</p>

<p>Make a circle on the palm of the left hand with the forefinger of the
right hand, to denote <i>coin</i>, and close the thumb and finger as if to
take the money, and put the hand forward to signify giving it to some one,
and move the hand a little apart from the place where it left the money,
and then close and withdraw the hand, as if to take the thing purchased.
(<i>Ballard</i>.)</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page454" id="page454"></a>[pg 454]</span>

<p><i>Italian sign</i>:</p>

<p>To indicate paying, in the language of the fingers, one makes as
though he put something, piece after piece, from one hand into the other&mdash;a
gesture, however, far less expressive than that when a man lacks
money, and yet cannot make up a face to beg it; or simply to indicate
want of money, which is to rub together the thumb and forefinger, at
the same time stretching out the hand. (<i>Butler</i>.) An illustration
from
De Jorio of the Neapolitan sign for <i>money</i> is given on page <a href="#page297">297</a>,
<i>supra</i>.</p>

<h5>&mdash;&mdash; EXCHANGE.</h5>

<p>The two forefingers are extended perpendicularly, and the hands are
then passed by each other transversely in front of the breast so as nearly
to exchange positions. (<i>Long</i>.)</p>

<p>Pass both hands, with extended forefingers, across each other before
the breast. (<i>Wied</i>.) See remarks on this author's sign for <span class="sc">Trade</span>,
<i>supra</i>.</p>

<p>Hands brought up to front of breast, forefingers extended and other
fingers slightly closed; hands suddenly drawn toward and past each
other until forearms are crossed in front of breast. (<i>Cheyenne</i> II.)
"Exchange;
right hand exchanging position with the left."</p>

<p>Left hand, with forefinger extended, others closed (M, except back of
hand outward), is brought, arm extended, in front of the left breast, and
the extended forefinger of the right hand, obliquely upward, others
closed, is placed crosswise over the left and maintained in that position
for a moment, when the fingers of the right hand are relaxed (as in Y),
brought near the breast with hand horizontal, palm inward, and then
carried out again in front of right breast twenty inches, with palm looking
toward the left, fingers pointing forward, hand horizontal, and then
the left hand performs the same movements on the left side of the body,
(<i>Dakota</i> I.) "You give me, I give you."</p>

<p>The hands, backs forward, are held as index hands, pointing upward,
the elbows being fully bent; each hand is then, simultaneously with the
other, moved to the opposite shoulder, so that the forearms cross one
another almost at right angles. (<i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i> I.)</p>

<h5>YES; AFFIRMATION; IT IS SO. (Compare <span class="sc">Good</span>.)</h5>

<p>The motion is somewhat like <i>truth</i>, viz: The forefinger in the
attitude
of pointing, from the mouth forward in a line curving a little upward, the
other fingers being carefully closed; but the finger is held rather more
upright, and is passed nearly straightforward from opposite the breast,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page455" id="page455"></a>[pg 455]</span>
and when at the end of its course it seems gently to strike something,
though with rather a slow and not suddenly accelerated motion.
(<i>Long</i>.)</p>

<p>Wave the hand straight forward from the face. (<i>Burton</i>.) This may
be compared with the forward nod common over most of the world for
assent, but that gesture is not universal, as the New Zealanders elevate
the head and chin, and the Turks are reported by several travelers to
shake the head somewhat like our negative. Rev. H.N. Barnum denies
that report, giving below the gesture observed by him. He, however,
describes the Turkish gesture sign for <i>truth</i> to be "gently bowing
with
head inclined to the right." This sidewise inclination may be what has
been called the shake of the head in affirmation.</p>

<p>Another: Wave the hand from the mouth, extending the thumb from
the index and closing the other three fingers. (<i>Burton</i>.)</p>

<p>Gesticulate vertically downward and in front of the body with the extended
forefinger (right hand usually), the remaining fingers and thumb
closed, their nails down. (<i>Creel</i>; <i>Arapaho</i> I.)</p>

<p>Right hand elevated to the level and in front of the shoulder, two first
fingers somewhat extended, thumb resting against the middle finger;
sudden motion in a curve forward and downward. (<i>Cheyenne</i> II.) It has
been suggested that the correspondence between this gesture and the
one given by the same gesturer for sitting (made by holding the right
hand to one side, fingers and thumb drooping, and striking downward
to the ground or object to be sat upon) seemingly indicates that the
origin of the former is in connection with the idea of "resting," or
"settling
a question." It is however at least equally probable that the forward
and downward curve is an abbreviation of the sign for <i>truth,
true</i>, a typical description of which follows given by (<i>Dakota</i>
I). The
sign for <i>true</i> can often be interchanged with that for <i>yes</i>, in
the same manner as the several words.</p>

<p>The index of the horizontal hand (M), other fingers closed, is carried
straight outward from the mouth. This is also the sign for <i>truth</i>.
(<i>Dakota</i> I.) "But one tongue."</p>

<p>Extend the right index, the thumb against it, nearly close the other
fingers, and holding it about a foot in front of the right breast, bend
the hand from the wrist downward until the end of the index has passed
about six inches through an arc. Some at the same time move the hand
forward a little. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.) "A nod; the hand representing the
head and the index the nose."</p>

<p>Hold the naturally closed hand before the right side of the breast, or
shoulder, leaving the index and thumb extended, then throw the hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page456" id="page456"></a>[pg 456]</span>
downward, bring the index against the inner side of the thumb.
(<i>Dakota</i>
VI, VII, VIII.) Fig. 280. Compare also Fig. 61, p. <a href="#page286">286</a>, <i>supra</i>,
Quintilian's sign for approbation.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/fig280.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig280.png" alt="Yes, affirmation. Dakota" /></a>Fig. 280.</div>

<p>The right hand, with the forefinger only extended
and pointing forward, is held before and
near the chest. It is then moved forward one or
two feet, usually with a slight curve downward.
(<i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i> I.)</p>

<p>Bend the right arm, pointing toward the chest
with the index finger; unbend, throwing the hand
up and forward. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>Another: Close the three fingers, close the thumb over them, extend
forefinger, and then shake forward and down. This is more emphatic
than the preceding, and signifies, <i>Yes, I know</i>. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>The right arm is raised to head with the index finger in type-position
(I1), modified by being more opened. From aside the head the hands
sweep in a curve to the right ear as of something entering or hearing
something; the finger is then more open and carried direct to the ground
as something emphatic or direct. (<i>Oto and Missouri</i> I.) "'I hear,'
emphatically
symbolized." It is doubted if this sign is more than an expression
of understanding which may or may not imply positive assent.
It would not probably be used as a direct affirmative, for instance, in
response to a question.</p>

<p>The hand open, palm downward, at the level of the breast, is moved
forward with a quick downward motion from the wrist, imitating a bow
of the head. (<i>Iroquois</i> I.)</p>

<p>Throw the closed right hand, with the index extended and bent, as
high as the face, and let it drop again naturally; but as the hand reaches
its greatest elevation the index is fully extended and suddenly drawn
into the palm, the gesture resembling a beckoning from above toward
the ground. (<i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i> II;
<i>Wichita</i> II.)</p>

<p>Quick motion of the right hand forward from the mouth; first position
about six inches from the mouth and final as far again away. In first
position the index finger is extended, the others closed; in final, the
index loosely closed, thrown in that position as the hand is moved forward,
as though hooking something with it; palm of hand out. (<i>Sahaptin</i> I.)</p>

<p>Another: Move right hand to a position in front of the body, letting
arm hang loosely at the side, the thumb standing alone, all fingers
hooked except forefinger, which is partially extended (E 1, palm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page457" id="page457"></a>[pg 457]</span>
upward). The sign consists in moving the forefinger from its partially
extended position to one similar to the others, as though making a sly
motion for some one to come to you. This is done once each tune the
assent is made. More emphatic than the preceding. (<i>Sahaptin</i> I.) "We
are together, think alike."</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute natural sign</i>:</p>

<p>Indicate by nodding the head. (<i>Ballard</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute sign</i>:</p>

<p>The French mutes unite the extremities of the index and thumb so as
to form a circle and move the hand downward with back vertical and
turned outward. It has been suggested in explanation that the circle
formed and exhibited is merely the letter O, the initial of the word
<i>oui</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fiji sign</i>:</p>

<p>Assent is expressed, not by a downward nod as with ourselves, but
by an upward nod; the head is jerked backward. Assent is also expressed
by uplifting the eyebrows. (<i>Fison</i>.)</p>

<p><i>Turkish sign</i>:</p>

<p>One or two nods of the head forward. (<i>Barnum</i>.)</p>

<h2>TRIBAL SIGNS.</h2>


<h5>ABSAROKA or CROW.</h5>

<p>The hands held out each side, and striking the air in the manner of
flying. (<i>Long</i>.)</p>

<p>Imitate the flapping of the bird's wings with the two hands, palms
downward, brought close to the shoulder. (<i>Burton</i>.)</p>

<p>Imitate the flapping of a bird's wings with the two hands, palms
to the front and brought close to the shoulder. (<i>Creel</i>.)</p>

<p>Place the flat hand as high as and in front or to the side of the right
shoulder, move it up and down, the motion occurring at the wrist. For
more thorough representation both hands are sometimes employed.
(<i>Arapaho</i> II; <i>Cheyenne</i> V; <i>Dakota</i> V, VI, VIII;
<i>Ponka</i> II; <i>Kaiowa</i> I;
<i>Pani</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i> II; <i>Wichita</i> II.)
"Bird's wing."</p>

<p>Both hands extended, with fingers joined (W), held near the shoulders,
and flapped to represent the wings of a crow. (<i>Dakota</i> II, III.)</p>

<p>At the height of the shoulders and a foot outward from them, move
the upright hands forward and backward twice or three times from the
wrist, palms forward, fingers and thumbs extended and separated a little;
then place the back or the palm of the upright opened right hand
against the upper part of the forehead; or half close the fingers,
placing the end of the thumb against the ends of the fore and middle
fingers, and then place the back of the hand against the forehead.
This sign is also made by the Arapahos. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.) "To imitate
the flying of a bird, and also indicate the manner in which the
Absaroka wear their hair."</p>

<p>Make with the arms the motion
of flapping wings. (<i>Kutine</i> I.)</p>

<p>The flat right hand, palm outward to the front and right, is held
in front of the right shoulder, and quickly waved back and forth a
few times. When made for the information of one ignorant of the common
sign, both hands are used, and the hands are moved outward from
the body, though still near the shoulder. (<i>Shoshoni and Banak</i> I.)
"Wings, <i>i.e.</i>, of a crow." Fig. 281.</p>

<p>Make either of the signs for <span class="sc">Poor, In Property</span>, by rubbing the index
back and forth over the extended left forefinger; or, by passing
the extended index alternately along the upper and lower sides
of the extended left forefinger from tip to base. (<i>Kaiowa</i> I;
<i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i> II; Wichita
II.) Fig. 282. "It is said that when the first Apache came to
the region they now occupy he was asked who or what he was, and not
understanding the language he merely made the sign for <i>poor</i>, which
expressed his condition."</p>

<p>Rub the back of the extended left forefinger from end to end with the
extended index. (<i>Comanche</i> II; <i>Ute</i> I.) "Poor,
poverty-stricken."</p>

<p>Place the back of the right hand near the end of the foot, the fingers
curved upward, to represent the turned-up toes of the moccasins. (<i>Pima

"Those who wear booted moccasins with turn-up toes."</p>

<h5>ARAPAHO.</h5>

<p>The fingers of one hand touch the breast in different parts, to indicate
the tattooing of that part in points. (<i>Long</i>.)</p>

<p>Seize the nose with the thumb and forefinger. (Randolph B. Marcy,
captain United States Army, in <i>The Prairie Traveler</i>. <i>New
York</i>, 1859, p. 215.)</p>

<p>Rub the right side of the nose with the forefinger: some call this tribe
the "Smellers," and make their sign consist of seizing the nose with
the thumb and forefinger. (<i>Burton</i>.)</p>

<p>Finger to side of nose. (<i>Macgowan</i>.)</p>

<p>Touch the left breast, thus implying what they call themselves, viz:
the "Good Hearts." (<i>Arapaho</i> I.)</p>

<p>Rub the side of the extended index against the right side of the nose.
(<i>Arapaho</i> II; <i>Cheyenne</i> V; <i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Comanche</i>
III; <i>Apache</i> II; <i>Wichita</i> II.)</p>

<p>Hold the left hand, palm down, and fingers extended; then with the
right hand, fingers extended, palm inward and thumb up, make a sudden
stroke from left to right across the back of the fingers of the left
hand, as if cutting them off. (<i>Sac, Fox, and Kickapoo</i> I.) This is
believed
to be an error of the authority, and should apply to the <span class="sc">Cheyenne</span>
tribal sign.</p>

<p>Join the ends of the fingers (the thumb included) of the right hand,
and, pointing toward the heart near the chest, throw the hand forward
and to the right once, twice, or many times, through an arc of about six
inches. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.) "Some say they use this sign because these
Indians tattoo their breasts."</p>

<p>Collect the fingers and thumb of the right hand to a point, and tap
the tips upon the left breast briskly. (<i>Comanche</i> II; <i>Ute</i> I.)
"Goodhearted."
It was stated by members of the various tribes at Washington,
in 1880, that this sign is used to designate the Northern Arapahos, while
that in which the index rubs against or passes upward alongside of
the nose refers to the Southern Arapahos.</p>

<p>Another: Close the right hand, leaving the index only extended; then
rub it up and down, held vertically, against the side of the nose where
it joins the cheek. (<i>Comanche</i> II; <i>Ute</i> I.)</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page461" id="page461"></a>[pg 461]</span>

<p>The fingers and thumb of the right hand, are brought to a point, and
tapped upon the right side of the breast. (<i>Shoshoni and Banak</i> I.)</p>

<h5>ARIKARA. (Corruptly abbreviated <span class="sc">Ree</span>.)</h5>

<div class="figright" style="width:25%;"><a href="images/fig284.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig284.png" alt="Arikara tribal sign. Arapaho and Dakota" /></a>Fig. 284.</div>

<p>Imitate the manner of shelling corn, holding the left hand stationary,
the shelling being done with the right. (<i>Creel</i>.) Fig. 284.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:15%;"><a href="images/fig285.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig285.png" alt="Arikara tribal sign. Absaroka" /></a>Fig. 285.</div>

<p>With the right hand closed, curve the thumb and index, join their
tips so as to form a circle, and place to the lobe of the ear.
(<i>Absaroka</i>
I; <i>Hidatsa</i> I.) "Big ear-rings." Fig. 285.</p>

<p>Both hands, fists, (B, except thumbs) in front of body, backs looking
toward the sides of the body, thumbs obliquely upward, left hand
stationary,
the backs of the fingers of the two hands touching, carry the
right thumb forward and backward at the inner side of the left thumb
and without moving the hand from the left, in imitation of the act of
shelling corn. (<i>Dakota</i> I, VII, VIII.)</p>

<p>Collect the fingers and thumb of the right hand nearly to a point, and
make a tattooing or dotting motion toward the upper
portion of the cheek. This is the
old sign, and was used by them previous
to the adoption of the more modern
one representing "corn-eaters."
(<i>Arikara</i> I.)</p>

<p>Place the back of the closed right hand
transversely before the mouth, and rotate
it forward and backward several
times. This gesture may be accompanied,
as it sometimes is, by a motion
of the jaws as if eating, to illustrate more fully the meaning of the
rotation
of the fist. (<i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Wichita</i> II;
<i>Apache</i> I.) "Corn-eater; eating corn from the ear."</p>

<p>Signified by the same motions with the thumbs and forefingers that
are used in shelling corn. The dwarf Ree (Arikara) corn is their peculiar
possession, which their tradition says was given to them by a superior
being, who led them to the Missouri River and instructed them how to
plant it. (Rev. C.L. Hall, in <i>The Missionary Herald</i>, April, 1880.)
"They
are the corn-shellers." Have seen this sign used by the Arikaras as a
tribal designation. (<i>Dakota</i> II.)</p>

<h5>ASSINABOIN.</h5>

<p>Hands in front of abdomen, horizontal, backs outward, ends of fingers
pointing toward one another, separated and arched (H), then, moved up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page462" id="page462"></a>[pg 462]</span>
and down and from side to side as though covering a corpulent body.
This sign is also used to indicate the Gros Ventres of the Prairie or
Atsina. (<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<p>Make the sign of <i>cutting the throat</i>. (<i>Kutine</i> I.) As the
Assinaboins
belong to the Dakotan stock, the sign generally given for the Sioux may
be used for them also.</p>

<p>With the right hand flattened, form a curve by passing it from the top
of the chest to the pubis, the fingers pointing to the left, and the back
forward. (<i>Shoshoni and Banak</i> I.) "Big bellies."</p>

<h5>ATSINA, LOWER GROS VENTRE.</h5>

<p>Both hands closed, the tips of the fingers pointing toward the wrist
and resting upon the base of the joint, the thumbs lying upon, and
extending over the middle joint of the forefingers; hold the left before
the chest, pointing forward, palm up, placing the right, with palm down,
just back of the left, and move as if picking small objects from the
left with the tip of the right thumb. (<i>Absaroka</i> I; <i>Shoshoni and
Banak</i> I.) "Corn-shellers."</p>

<p>Bring the extended and separated fingers and thumb loosely to a point,
flexed at the metacarpal joints; point them toward the left clavicle, and
imitate a dotting motion as if tattooing the skin. (<i>Kaiowa</i> I;
<i>Comanche</i>
III; <i>Apache</i> II; <i>Wichita</i> II.) "They used to tattoo themselves,
and live in the country south of the Dakotas."</p>

<p>See also the sign of (<i>Dakota</i> I) under <span class="sc">Assinaboin</span>.</p>

<h5>BANAK.</h5>

<p>Make a whistling sound "phew" (beginning at a high note and ending
about an octave lower); then draw the extended index across the throat
from the left to the right and out to nearly at arm's length. They used
to cut the throats of their prisoners. (<i>Pai-Ute</i> I.)</p>

<p>Major Haworth states that the <i>Banaks</i> make the following sign for
themselves: Brush the flat right hand backward over the forehead as
if forcing back the hair. This represents the manner of wearing the
tuft of hair backward from the forehead. According to this informant,
the Shoshoni use the same sign for <span class="sc">Banak</span> as for themselves.</p>

<h5>BLACKFEET. (This title refers to the Algonkian Blackfeet, properly
called <span class="sc">Satsika</span>. For the Dakota Blackfeet, or Sihasapa, see under
head of <span class="sc">Dakota</span>.)</h5>

<p>The finger and thumb encircle the ankle. (<i>Long</i>.)</p>

<p>Pass the right hand, bent spoon-fashion, from the heel to the little toe
of the right foot. (<i>Burton</i>.)</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page463" id="page463"></a>[pg 463]</span>

<p>The palmar surfaces of the extended fore and second fingers of the
right hand (others closed) are rubbed along the leg just above the ankle.
This would not seem to be clear, but these Indians do not make any
sign indicating <i>black</i> in connection with the above. The sign does
not,
however, interfere with any other sign as made by the Sioux. (<i>Creel</i>;
<i>Dakota</i> I.) "Black feet."</p>

<p>Pass the flat hand over the outer edge of the right foot from the heel
to beyond the toe, as if brushing off dust. (<i>Dakota</i> V, VII, VIII.)
Fig. 286.</p>

<p>Close the right hand, thumb resting over the second joint of the
forefinger,
palm toward the face, and rotate over the cheek, though an inch
or two from it. (<i>Shoshoni and Banak</i> I.) "From manner of painting
the cheeks." Fig. 287.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page464" id="page464"></a>[pg 464]</span>

<h5>CADDO.</h5>

<p>Pass the horizontally extended index from right to left under the nose.
(<i>Arapaho</i> II; <i>Cheyenne</i> V; <i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> I,
II, III; <i>Apache</i> II;
<i>Wichita</i> I, II.) "'Pierced noses,' from former custom of perforating
the
septum for the reception of rings." Fig. 288. This sign is also used for
the Sahaptin. For some remarks see page <a href="#page345">345</a>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:50%;"><a href="images/fig288.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig288.png" alt="Caddo tribal sign. Arapaho and Kaiowa" /></a>Fig. 288.</div>

<h5>CALISPEL. See <span class="sc">Pend d'Oreille</span>.</h5>

<h5>CHEYENNE.</h5>

<p>Draw the hand across the arm, to imitate cutting it with a knife.
(<i>Marcy</i> in <i>Prairie Traveller</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 215.)</p>

<p>Draw the lower edge of the right hand across the left arm as if
gashing it with a knife. (<i>Burton</i>.)</p>

<p>With the index-finger of the right hand proceed as if cutting the left
arm in different places with a sawing motion from the wrist upward, to
represent the cuts or burns on the arms of that nation. (<i>Long</i>.)</p>

<p>Bridge palm of left hand with index-finger of right. (<i>Macgowan</i>.)</p>

<p>Draw the extended right hand, fingers joined, across the left wrist as
if cutting it. (<i>Arapaho</i> I.)</p>

<p>Pass the ulnar side of the extended index repeatedly across the extended
finger and back of
the left hand. Frequently,
however, the index is drawn
across the wrist or forearm.
(<i>Arapaho</i> II; <i>Cheyenne</i> V;
<i>Ponka</i> II; <i>Pani</i> I.) Fig.
289. See p. <a href="#page345">345</a> for remarks.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:60%;"><a href="images/fig289.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig289.png" alt="Cheyenne tribal sign. Arapaho and Cheyenne" /></a>Fig. 289.</div>

<p>The extended index, palm upward, is drawn across the forefinger of
the left hand (palm inward), several times, left hand stationary, right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page465" id="page465"></a>[pg 465]</span>
hand is drawn toward the body until the index is drawn clear off; then
repeat. Some Cheyennes believe this to have reference to the former
custom of cutting the arm as offerings to spirits, while others think it
refers to a more ancient custom of cutting off the enemy's fingers for
necklaces. (<i>Cheyenne</i> II.)</p>

<p>Place the extended index at the right side of the nose, where it joins
the face, the tip reaching as high, as the forehead, and close to the inner
corner of the eye. This position makes the thumb of the right hand rest
upon the chin, while the index is perpendicular. (<i>Sac, Fox, and
Kickapoo</i>
I.) It is considered that this sign, though given to the collaborator
as expressed, was an error. It applies to the Southern Arapahos.
Lieutenant Creel states the last remark to be correct, the gesture having
reference to the Southern bands.</p>

<p>As though sawing through the left forearm at its middle with the
edge of the right held back outward, thumb upward. Sign made at the
left side of the body. (<i>Dakota</i> I.) "Same sign as for a <i>saw</i>.
The
Cheyenne Indians are known to the Sioux by the name of 'The Saws.'"</p>

<p>Right-hand fingers and thumb extended and joined (as in S), outer
edge downward, and drawn sharply across the other fingers and forearm
as if cutting with a knife. (<i>Dakota</i>, III.)</p>

<p>Draw the extended right index or the ulnar (inner) edge of the open
right hand several times across the base of the extended left index, or
across the left forearm at different heights from left to right. This sign
is also made by the Arapahos. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.) "Because their arms are
marked with scars from cuts which they make as offerings to spirits."</p>

<p>Draw the extended index several times across the extended forefinger
from the tip toward the palm, the latter pointing forward and slightly
toward the right. From the custom of striping arms transversely with
colors. (<i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> II, III; <i>Apache</i> II;
<i>Ute</i> I; <i>Wichita</i> II.)</p>

<p>Another: Make the sign for <span class="sc">Dog</span>, viz: Close the right hand, leaving
the index and second fingers only extended and joined, hold it forward
from and lower than the hip and draw it backward, the course following
the outline of a dog's form from head to tail; then add the sign <span class="sc">To Eat</span>,
as follows: Collect the thumb, index, and second fingers to a point, hold
them above and in front of the mouth and make a repeated dotting motion
toward the mouth. This sign is generally used, but the other and
more common one is also employed, especially so with individuals not
fully conversant with the sign language as employed by the Comanches,
&amp;c. (<i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i> II; <i>Wichita</i>
II.) "Dog-eaters."</p>

<p>Draw the extended index across the back of the left hand and arm as
if cutting it. The index does not touch the arm as in signs given for
the same tribe by other Indians, but is held at least four or five inches
from it. (<i>Shoshoni and Banak</i> I.)</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page466" id="page466"></a>[pg 466]</span>

<h5>CHIPEWAY. See <span class="sc">Ojibwa</span>.</h5>

<h5>COMANCHE.</h5>

<p>Imitate, by the waving of the hand or forefinger, the forward crawling
motion of a snake. (<i>Burton</i>, also <i>Blackmore</i> in introduction to
Dodge's
<i>Plains of the Great West</i>. <i>New York</i>, 1877, p. xxv.) The same sign is
used for the Shoshoni, more commonly called "Snake", Indians, who as
well as the Comanches belong to the Shoshonian linguistic family. "The
silent stealth of the tribe." (<i>Dodge; Marcy</i> in <i>Thirty Years of
Army
Life on the Border</i>. <i>New York</i>, 1866, p. 33.) Rev. A.J. Holt remarks,
however, that among the Comanches themselves the conception of this
sign is the trailing of a rope, or lariat. This refers probably to their
well-known horsemanship.</p>

<p>Motion of a snake. (<i>Macgowan</i>.)</p>

<p>Hold the elbow of the right arm near the right side, but not touching
it; extend the forearm and hand, palm inward, fingers joined on a level
with the elbow, then with a shoulder movement draw the forearm and
hand back until the points of the fingers are behind the body; at the
same time that the hand is thus being moved back, turn it right and
left several times. (<i>Creel</i>; <i>Sac, Fox, and Kickapoo</i> I.) "Snake in the
grass. A snake drawing itself back in the grass instead of crossing the
road in front of you."</p>

<p>Another: The sign by and for the Comanches themselves is made by
holding both hands and arms upward from the elbow, both palms inward,
and passing both hands with their backs upward along the lower
end of the hair to indicate <i>long hair</i>, as they never cut it.
(<i>Sac, Fox, and Kickapoo</i> I.)</p>

<p>Right hand horizontal, flat, palm downward (W), advanced to the
front by a motion to represent the crawling of a snake. (<i>Dakota</i>
III.)</p>

<p>Extend the closed right hand to the front and left; extend the index,
palm down, and rotate from side to side while drawing it back to the
right hip. (<i>Arapaho</i> II; <i>Cheyenne</i> V; <i>Dakota</i> VI, VII,
VIII; <i>Ponka</i> II;
<i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Pani</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i> II;
<i>Wichita</i> II.) This motion
is just the reverse of the sign for <i>Shoshoni</i>, see Fig. 297 <i>infra</i>.</p>

<p>Make the reverse gesture for <i>Shoshoni</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, begin away from
the body, drawing the hand back to the side of the right hip while rotating
it. (<i>Comanche</i> II.)</p>

<h5>CREE, KNISTENO, KRISTENEAUX.</h5>

<p>Sign for <span class="sc">Wagon</span> and then the sign for <span class="sc">Man</span>. (<i>Dakota</i> I.) "This
indicates the Red River half-breeds, with their carts, as these people are
so known from their habit of traveling with carts."</p>

<p>Place the first and second fingers of the right hand in front of the
mouth. (<i>Kutine</i> I.)</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page467" id="page467"></a>[pg 467]</span>

<h5>CROW. See <span class="sc">Absaroka</span>.</h5>

<h5>DAKOTA, or SIOUX.</h5>

<p>The edge of the hand passed across the throat, as in the act of cutting
that part. (<i>Long</i>; <i>Marcy</i> in <i>Army Life</i>, p. 33.)</p>

<p>Draw the lower edge of the hand across the throat. (<i>Burton</i>.)</p>

<p>Draw the extended right hand across the throat. (<i>Arapaho</i> I.) "The
cut-throats."</p>

<p>Pass the flat right hand, with palm down, from left to right across the
throat. (<i>Arapaho</i> II; <i>Cheyenne</i> V; <i>Dakota</i> VI, VIII;
<i>Ponka</i> II; <i>Pani</i> I.)</p>

<p>Draw the forefinger of the left hand from right to left across the
throat. (<i>Sac, Fox, and Kickapoo</i> I.) "A cut-throat."</p>

<p>Forefinger and thumb of right hand extended (others closed) is drawn
from left to right across the throat as though cutting it. The Dakotas
have been named the "cut-throats" by some of the surrounding tribes.
(<i>Dakota</i> I.) "Cut-throats."</p>

<p>Right hand horizontal, flat, palm downward (as in W), and drawn
across the throat as if cutting with a knife. (<i>Dakota</i> II, III.)</p>

<p>Draw the open right hand, or the right index, from left to right
horizontally
across the throat, back of hand upward, fingers pointing toward
the left. This sign is also made by the Arapahos. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.) "It
is said that after a battle the Utes took
many Sioux prisoners and cut their
throats; hence the sign "cut-throats."</p>

<p>Draw the extended right hand, palm
downward, across the throat from left to
right. (<i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> II, III;

Fig. 286, above.</p>

<p>Pass the right hand quickly over the right foot from the great toe
outward, turn the heel as if brushing something therefrom. (<i>Dakota</i>
V.)</p>

<p>Pass the widely separated thumb and index of the right hand over the
lower leg, from just below the knee nearly down to the heel. (<i>Kaiowa</i>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page468" id="page468"></a>[pg 468]</span>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;, Brul&#233;.</p>

<p>Rub the upper and outer part of the right thigh in a small circle with
the open right hand, fingers pointing downward. This sign is also made
by the Arapahos. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.) "These Indians were once caught in
a prairie fire, many burned to death, and others badly burned about
the thighs; hence the name Si-ca<sup>n</sup>-gu 'burnt thigh' and the sign.
According to the Brul&#233; chronology, this fire occurred in 1763, which they
call 'The-People-were-burned-winter.'"</p>

<p>Pass the flat right hand quickly over the thigh from near the buttock
forward, as if brushing dust from that part. (<i>Dakota</i> V, VI, VII,
VIII.)</p>

<p>Brush the palm of the right hand over the right thigh, from near the
buttock toward the front of the middle third of the thigh. (<i>Kaiowa</i>
I; <i>Comanche</i> III; <i>Apache</i> II; <i>Wichita</i> II.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;, Ogalala.</p>

<p>Fingers and thumb separated, straight (as in R), and dotted about
over the face to represent the marks made by the small-pox. (<i>Arapaho</i>
II; <i>Cheyenne</i> V; <i>Dakota</i> III, VI, VII, VIII.) "This band
suffered from the disease many years ago."</p>

<p>With the thumb over the ends of the fingers, hold the right hand
upright, its back forward, about six inches in front of the face, or on
one side of the nose near the face,
and suddenly extend and spread all
the fingers, thumb included. (<i>Dakota</i>
IV.) "The word <i>Ogalala</i> means

<p>Cheyennes make the same sign as (<i>Comanche</i> II), and think it was
intended to convey the idea of cropping the hair. The men wear one side
of the hair of the head full length and done up as among the Cheyennes,
the other side being kept cropped off about even with the neck
and hanging loose. (<i>Cheyenne</i> II.)</p>

<p>With the index and second
fingers only extended and
separated, hold the hand at
arm's length to the front of
the left side; draw it back
in distinct jerks; each time
the hand rests draw the fingers
back against the inside
of the thumb, and when the hand is again started on the next movement
backward snap the fingers to full length. This is repeated five
or six times during the one movement of the hand. The country which
the Lipans at one time occupied contained large ponds or lakes, and
along the shores of these the reptile was found which gave them this
characteristic appellation. (<i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Comanche</i> III;

angles with the palm; pass it horizontally
to the left by and under the
nose. (<i>Comanche</i> II.) "Pierced nose."
Fig. 296. This sign is made by the
Nez Perc&#233;s for themselves, according

was received from Arapaho and Cheyenne Indians, who visited Washington
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page474" id="page474"></a>[pg 474]</span>
in 1880, that this sign is also used to designate the <i>Caddos</i>, who
practiced the same custom of perforating the nasal septum. The same
informants also state that the <i>Shawnees</i> are sometimes indicated by
the same sign.</p>

<p>Pass the extended index, pointing toward the left, remaining fingers
and thumb closed, in front of and across the upper lip, just below the

<p>Rub the back of the extended flat left hand with the extended fingers
of the right, then touch some black object. Represents black skin.
Although the same sign is generally used to signify <i>negro</i>, an
addition
is sometimes made as follows: place the index and second fingers to the
hair on the right side of the head, and rub them against each other to
signify <i>curly hair</i>. This addition is only made when the connection
would cause a confusion between the "black skin" Indian (<i>Ute</i>) and
negro. (<i>Arapaho</i> II; <i>Cheyenne</i> V.)</p>

<h5>WICHITA.</h5>

<p>Indicate a circle over the upper portion of the right cheek, with the

authorities for the above is that years ago the Wichita women painted
spiral lines on the breasts, starting at the nipple and extending several
inches from it; but after an increase in modesty or a change in the upper
garment, by which the breast ceased to be exposed, the cheek has been
adopted as the locality for the sign. (<i>Creel</i>; <i>Kaiowa</i> I;
<i>Comanche</i> III;
<i>Apache</i> II; <i>Wichita</i> II.)</p>

<p>Extend the fingers and thumb of the right hand, semi-closed, and
bring the hand toward the face nearly touching it, repeating this several
times as if going through the motion of tattooing. The Comanches
call the Wichitas "Painted Faces"; Caddos call them "Tattooed Faces,"
both tribes using the same sign. (<i>Comanche</i> I.)</p>

<p>Raise the right hand above the head (J 2), palm to the front, all the
fingers closed except the index, hand slanting a little to backward, then
move forward and downward toward the person addressed, describing a
curve. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<h5>YOU GAVE US MANY CLOTHES, BUT WE DON'T WANT THEM.</h5>

<p>Lean forward, and, holding the hands concavo-convex, draw them up
over the limbs severally, then cross on the chest as wrapping a blanket.
The arms are then extended before the body, with the hands in
type-position
(W), to a height indicating a large pile. The right hand then
sweeps outward, showing a negative state of mind. The index of right
hand finally touches the chest of the second party and approaches the
body, in position (I), horizontal. (<i>Oto and Missouri</i> I.) "Something
to put on that I don't want from you."</p>

<h5>QUESTION. See also this title in <span class="sc">Extracts from Dictionary</span>.</h5>

<p>Hold the extended and flattened right hand, palm forward, at the
height of the shoulder or face, and about fifteen inches from it, shaking
the hand from side to side (at the wrist) as the arm is slightly raised,
resembling the outline of an interrogation mark (<i>?</i>) made from below
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page481" id="page481"></a>[pg 481]</span>
upward. (<i>Absaroka</i> I; <i>Dakota</i> V, VI, VII; <i>Hidatsa</i> I;
<i>Kaiowa</i> I; <i>Arikara</i>
I;
<i>Comanche</i> II, III; <i>Pai-Ute</i> I; <i>Shoshoni and Banak</i> I;
<i>Ute</i> I;
<i>Apache</i> I, II; <i>Wichita</i> II.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; What? What is it?</p>

<p>First attract the person's notice by the sign for <i>attention</i>, viz:
The
right hand (T) carried directly out in front of the body, with arm fully
extended and there moved sidewise with rapid motions; and then the
right hand, fingers extended, pointing forward or outward, fingers joined,
horizontal, is carried outward, obliquely in front of the right breast, and
there turned partially over and under several times. (<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; What are you doing? What do you want?</p>

<p>Throw the right hand about a foot from right to left several times,
describing an arc with its convexity upward, palm inward, fingers
slightly bent and separated, and pointing forward. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; When?</p>

<p>With its index extended and pointing forward, back upward, rotate
the right hand several times to the right and left, describing an arc
with the index. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; What are you? <i>i.e.</i>, What tribe do you belong to?</p>

<p>Shake the upright open right hand four to eight inches from side to
side a few times, from twelve to eighteen inches in front of the chin, the
palm forward, fingers relaxed and a little separated. (<i>Dakota</i> IV.)</p>

<p>It must be remarked that in the three preceding signs there is no
essential difference, either between themselves or between them and the
general sign for <span class="sc">Question</span> above given, which can be applied to the
several special questions above mentioned. A similar remark may be
made regarding several signs given below, which are printed in deference
to collaborators.</p>

<p>Pass the right hand from left to right across the face. (<i>Kutine</i> I.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; What do you want?</p>

<p>The arm is drawn to front of chest and the hand in position (N 1),
modified by palms being downward and hand horizontal. From the
chest center the hand is then passed spirally forward toward the one
addressed; the hand's palm begins the spiral motion with a downward
and ends in an upward aspect. (<i>Oto</i> I.) "To unwind or open."</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Whence come you?</p>

<p>First the sign for <i>you</i>, viz: The hand open, held upward obliquely,
and pointing forward; then the hand, extended open and drawn to the
breast, and lastly the sign for <i>bringing</i>, as follows: The hand half
shut, with the thumb pressing against the forefinger, being first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page482" id="page482"></a>[pg 482]</span>
moderately extended either to the right or left, is brought with a moderate
jerk to the opposite side, as if something was pulled along by the hand.
(<i>Dunbar</i>.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Who are you? or what is your name?</p>

<p>The right or left hand approximates close to center of the body; the
arm is flexed and hand in position (D), or a little more closed. From
inception of sign near center of body the hand slowly describes the arc
of a quadrant, and fingers unfold as the hand recedes. We think the
proper intention is for the inception of sign to be located at the heart,
but it is seldom truly, anatomically thus located. (<i>Oto</i> I.) "To
unfold one's self or make known."</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Are you through?</p>

<p>With arms hanging at the side and forearms horizontal, place the fists
near each other in front of body: then with a quick motion separate
them as though breaking something asunder. (<i>Sahaptin</i> I.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Do you know?</p>

<p>Shake the right hand in front of the face, a little to the right, the
whole arm elevated so as to throw the hand even with the face, and the
forearm standing almost perpendicular. Principal motion with hand,
slight motion of forearm, palm out. (<i>Sahaptin</i> I.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; How far is it?</p>

<p>Sign for <span class="sc">Do you know?</span> followed with a precise movement throwing
right hand (palm toward face) to a position as far from body as convenient,
signifying <i>far</i>; then with the same quick, precise motion,
bring the hand to a position near the face&mdash;<i>near</i>. (<i>Sahaptin</i>
I.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; How will you go&mdash;horseback or in wagon?</p>

<p>First make the sign for <span class="sc">Do you know?</span> then throw right hand
forward&mdash;<i>go</i>
or <i>going</i>; then throw fore and middle fingers of right
astride the forefinger of the left hand,
signifying, <i>will you ride?</i>; then swing the
forefingers of each hand around each
other, sign of <i>wheel running</i>, signifying,
<i>or will you go in wagon</i>? (<i>Sahaptin</i> I.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; How many?</p>

<p>After making the sign for <i>question</i>,
touch the tips of as many of the extended
and separated fingers of the left hand
held in front of the body upright, with
back outward, with the right index as
may be necessary. (<i>Dakota</i> I.) "Count
them off to me&mdash;how many?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:40%;"><a href="images/fig302.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig302.png" alt="Counting. How many? Shoshoni and Banak" /></a>Fig. 302.</div>

<p>Place the left hand carelessly before
the breast, fingers extended and slightly separated, back to the front,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page483" id="page483"></a>[pg 483]</span>
then count off a few with the extended index, by laying down the fingers
of the left, beginning at the little finger, as in Fig. 302. In asking
the question, the sign for <i>question</i> must precede the sign for
<i>many</i>, the latter
being also accompanied by a look of interrogation. (<i>Shoshoni and
Banak</i> I.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Has he?</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute natural sign</i>:</p>

<p>Move to and fro the finger several times toward the person spoken of
(<i>Larson</i>.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Have you?</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute natural sign</i>:</p>

<p>Move the finger to and fro several times toward the person to whom
the one is speaking. (<i>Larson</i>.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Are you?</p>

<p><i>Deaf-mute natural signs</i>:</p>

<p>Point to the person spoken to and slightly nod the head, with an inquiring
look. (<i>Ballard</i>.)</p>

<p>Point with the forefinger, as if to point toward the second person, at
the same time nod the head as if to say "yes." (<i>Ziegler</i>.)</p>

<p>The following was obtained at Washington during the winter of
1880-'81 from Ta-ta<sup>n</sup>-ka Wa-ka<sup>n</sup> (Medicine Bull), a Brul&#233; Dakota chief;
by Dr. <span class="sc">W.J. Hoffman</span>.</p>

<h5>I AM GOING HOME IN TWO DAYS.</h5>

<p>(1) Place the flat hands in front of and as high as the elbows, palms
down, pass each hand across to the opposite side of the body, the right
above the left crossing near the wrist at the termination of the gesture
(<i>night</i>), repeat in quick succession&mdash;<i>nights</i>, (2) elevate the
extended index
and second finger of the right hand, backs to the front&mdash;<i>two</i>, (3)
place the tips of the extended and joined fingers of the right hand against
the breast&mdash;<i>I</i>, (4) after touching the breast as in the preceding,
pass
the extended index from the breast, pointing downward, forward nearly
to arm's length, and terminating by holding the hand but continuing
the motion of the index until it points forward and upward&mdash;<i>am going
to</i>, (5) throw the clinched right fist about six inches toward the earth
at arm's length after the completion of the preceding gesture&mdash;<i>my
home</i>.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the gesture No. 4, "am going to," was made before
the gesture No. 5, "my home," although the Dakota words pronounced
were in the reverse order, showing a difference in the syntax of
the gestures and of the oral speech in this instance. The other gestures,
1, 2, and 3, had been made deliberately, the Dakota word translating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page484" id="page484"></a>[pg 484]</span>
each being in obvious connection with the several gestures, but the two
final words were pronounced rapidly together as if they could not in the
mind of the gesturer be applied separately to the reversed order of the
signs for them.</p>

<hr />

<p>The same authority obtained the above sentence in Ponka and Pani,
together with the following signs for it, from individuals of those tribes.
Those signs agreed between each other, but differed from the Dakota,
as will be observed, in the signs <i>to my house</i>, as signifying <i>to
my home</i>.</p>

<p>(1) Touch the breast with the tips of the extended fingers&mdash;<i>I</i>. This
precedes the signs for Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5, which correspond to Nos. 1,
2, 3, and 4 of the Dakota; then follows: (6) place the tips of the extended
fingers of the flat hands together, leaving the wrists about six
inches apart&mdash;<i>lodge</i>, (7) and conclude by placing the clinched fists
nearly at arm's length before the body, the right several inches above
the left, then throw them toward the ground&mdash;about six or eight inches&mdash;the
fists retaining their relative positions&mdash;<i>my</i>, <i>mine</i>.</p>

<h2>DIALOGUES.</h2>


<h3><i>TENDOY-HUERITO DIALOGUE.</i></h3>

<p>The following conversation took place at Washington in April, 1880,
between <span class="sc">Tendoy</span>, chief of the Shoshoni and Banak Indians of Idaho,
and <span class="sc">Huerito</span>, one of the Apache chiefs from New Mexico, in the presence
of Dr. <span class="sc">W.J. Hoffman</span>. Neither of these Indians spoke any language
known to the other, or had ever met or heard of one another before
that occasion:</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:45%;"><a href="images/fig304.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig304.png" alt="Question. Apache" /></a>Fig. 304.</div>

<p><i>Huerito</i>.&mdash;<span class="sc">Who are you?</span></p>

<p>Place the flat and extended right hand, palm forward, about twelve inches
in front of and as high as the shoulder, then shake the hand from side to
side
as it is moved forward and upward&mdash;<i>question, who are you?</i> Fig. 304.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:45%;"><a href="images/fig305.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig305.png" alt="Shoshoni tribal sign. Shoshoni" /></a>Fig. 305.</div>

<p><i>Tendoy</i>.&mdash;<span class="sc">Shoshoni chief.</span></p>

<p>Place the closed right hand near the right hip leaving the index only
extended, palm down; then pass the hand toward the front and left,
rotating it from side to side&mdash;<i>Shoshoni</i>, Fig. 305; then place the
closed hand, with the index extended and pointing upward, near the right
cheek, pass it upward as high as the head, then turn it forward and
downward toward the ground, terminating with the movement a little
below the initial point&mdash;<i>chief</i>. Fig. 306.</p>

<p><i>Huerito</i>.&mdash;<span class="sc">How old are you?</span></p>

<p>Clinch both hands and cross the forearms before the breast with a
trembling motion&mdash;<i>cold&mdash;winter, year</i>, Fig. 307; then elevate the
left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page487" id="page487"></a>[pg 487]</span>
hand as high as the neck and about twelve or fifteen inches before it,
palm toward the face, with fingers extended and pointing upward; then,
with the index, turn down one finger after another slowly, beginning at

<p>Close and extend the fingers and thumbs of both hands, with the
palms forward, five times&mdash;<i>fifty</i>; then extend
the fingers and thumb of the left

<p><i>Huerito</i>.&mdash;<span class="sc">Very well. Are there any buffalo in your country?</span></p>

<p>Place the flat right hand, pointing to the left, with the palm down,
against the breast-bone; then move it forward and slightly to the right
and in an upward curve; make the gesture rather slow and nearly to
arm's length (otherwise, <i>i.e.</i>, if made hastily and but a short
distance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page488" id="page488"></a>[pg 488]</span>

closed hands
to their respective sides of the head, palms toward the hair, leaving
the forefingers curved&mdash;<i>buffalo</i>, see Fig. 298, p. <a href="#page477">477</a>; then reach
out the fist to arm's length toward the west, and throw it forcibly toward the
ground for a distance of about six inches, edge downward&mdash;<i>country, away

<p>Pass the closed right hand, with the index partly flexed, to a position
about eight inches before the right collar-bone, and, as the hand
reaches that elevation, quickly close the index&mdash;<i>yes</i>; then make
the same sign as in the preceding question for <i>buffalo</i>; touch the
hair on the right side of the head with the palms of the extended
fingers of the right hand&mdash;<i>black</i>;
spread the curved fingers and
thumbs of both hands, place them
before either thigh, pointing downward;

the palmar surface of the finger
horizontally across the forehead,
pointing to the left, allow the
thumb to rest against the right
temple; then draw the index
across the forehead from left to
right, leaving the thumb touching
the head&mdash;<i>white man</i>; then place the closed hand, with elevated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page489" id="page489"></a>[pg 489]</span>
index, before the right side of the neck or in front of the top of the
shoulder;
pass the index, pointing upward, as high as the top of the head; turn it
forward and downward as far as the breast&mdash;<i>chief</i>; pass the extended
index, pointing up ward and forward, forward from the mouth
twice&mdash;<i>talk</i>;

the index and thumb by allowing their tips to touch; pass the hand
from east to west at arm's length&mdash;<i>day</i>; place the left hand before
the breast, the fingers extended, and the thumb resting against the palm,
back forward, and, with the index, turn down one finger after another,
beginning at the little finger&mdash;<i>four</i>; touch the breast with the tips
of the

the
hand off slowly toward the left, <i>i.e.</i>, toward the north to arm's
length&mdash;<i>go

then hold both hands toward the left as high as the head, palms down,
with fingers and thumbs pendent and separated; move them toward the
ground two or three times&mdash;<i>rain</i>, Fig. 313; then place the flat hands
horizontally to the left of the body about
two feet from the ground&mdash;<i>deep</i>; (literally,
<i>deep rain</i>) <i>snow</i>&mdash;and raise them
until about three feet from the ground&mdash;<i>very
deep</i>&mdash;<i>much</i>; place the hands before the body about twelve inches apart,
palms down, with forefingers only extended and pointing toward one another;
push them toward and from one another several times&mdash;<i>see each
other</i>, Fig. 314; then hold the flat right
hand in front of the breast, pointing
forward, palm to the left, and throw it
over on its back toward the right&mdash;<i>not, no more</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Explanatory Note</span>.&mdash;Where the asterisks appear in the above dialogue
the preposition <i>to</i> is included in the gesture. After touching the
breast for <i>I</i>, the slow movement forward signifies <i>going to</i>,
and <i>country</i>
is signified by locating it at arm's length toward the west, to the left of
the gesturer, as the stopping-place, also <i>possession</i> by the clinched
fist being
directed toward the ground. It is the same as for <i>my</i> or <i>mine</i>,
though made before the body in the latter signs. The direction of Tendoy's
hands, first to the south and afterwards to the north, was understood
not as pointing to the exact locality of the two parts of the country,
but to the difference in their respective climates.</p>

<h3><i>DIALOGUE BETWEEN ALASKAN INDIANS.</i></h3>

<p>The following introductory notes are furnished by <span class="sc">Mr. Ivan Petroff</span>,
who contributes the Dialogue:</p>

<p>It has been repeatedly stated that among the natives of Alaska no
trace of gesture or sign language can be found. The universal spread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page493" id="page493"></a>[pg 493]</span>
of the Russian language in former times as a medium of trade and general
intercourse has certainly prevented observations of this primitive
linguistic feature in all the vast regions visited by the Russians. On
the other hand, the homogeneous elements of the Innuit tongue, spoken
along the whole seacoast from the Arctic to the Alaskan Peninsula, and
the Island of Kadiak, has, to a great extent, abolished all causes for the
employment of sign language between tribes in their mutual intercourse.
Basing their opinions upon what they saw while touching upon the coast
here and there, even the acknowledged authorities on Alaskan matters
have declared that sign language did not and could not exist in all that
country. Without entering into any lengthened dispute upon this question,
I venture to present in the subjoined pages a succinct account of
at least one instance where I saw natives of different tribes converse
with each other only by means of signs and gestures within the boundaries
of Alaska.</p>

<p>In the month of September, 1866, there arrived on the Lower Kinnik
River, a stream emptying its waters into Cook's Inlet, two Indians from
a distant region, who did not speak the Kenaitze language. The people
of the settlement at which the strangers made their first appearance
were equally at a loss to understand the visitors. At last a chief of
great age, bearing the name of Chatidoolts (mentioned by Vancouver
as a youth), was found to be able to interpret some of the signs made
by the strangers, and after a little practice he entered into a continued
conversation with them in rather a roundabout way, being himself
blind. He informed me that it was the second or third time within his
recollection that strangers like those then present had come to Kinnik
from the northeast, but that in his youth he had frequently "talked
with his hands" to their visitors from the west and east. He also told
me that he had acquired this art from his father, who, as the old man
expressed himself, had "seen every country, and spoken to all the tribes
of the earth." The conversation was carried on with the help of the old
man's sons, who described to their blind parent the gestures of the
strangers, and were instructed in turn by him with what gestures to
reply.</p>

<p>This being an entirely new experience to me I at once proceeded to
carefully make notes of the desultory talk, extending over several days.
My object, primarily, was to make use of the signs for purposes of trade
in the future.</p>

<p>The notes thus obtained contain a narrative of the two strangers,
interpreted
to me at the time by Chatidoolts. I shall present each sign
or sentence as I noted it at the time, with only casual reference to that
incomplete and frequently erroneous interpretation.</p>

<p>The two Indians wore the pointed hunting shirt of tanned moose-skin,
ornamented with beads and fringes which is still common to the Kutchin
tribes. They were not tattooed, but ears and noses were encumbered
with pendants of dentalium and a small red glass bead. Their feet were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page494" id="page494"></a>[pg 494]</span>
clothed in moccasins. One of them had a rifle of English manufacture,
and his companion carried two huge knives, one of them of copper evidently
of native manufacture.</p>

<h3><i>OJIBWA DIALOGUE.</i></h3>

<h4>[Communicated by the Very Rev. <span class="sc">Edward Jacker</span>.]</h4>

<p>The following short dialogue forms part of the scanty tradition the
civilized Ojibwas possess regarding their ancestors' sign language:</p>

<p>Two Indians of different tongue meet on a journey. First Indian
points to second Indian with the outstretched forefinger of the right
hand, bringing it within a few inches of his breast; next he extends
both forearms horizontally, clinches all but the forefingers, and bends
the hands inward; then he brings them slowly and in a straight line
together, until the tips of the outstretched forefingers meet. This gesture
is accompanied with a look of inquiry&mdash;<i>You met somebody?</i></p>

<p>Second Indian, facing the south, points to the east, and with the
outstretched
hand forms a half-circle from east to west (corresponding to the
daily course of the sun); then he raises the arm and points to a certain
height above the southern horizon. Then the sign for <i>meeting</i> (as above)
may be made, or omitted. After this he bends the right hand downward,
and repeatedly moves the outstretched forefinger and middle finger in opposite
directions (in imitation of the motion of the legs in the act of walking).
Finally he raises the right hand and stretches up the forefinger (or several
fingers). <i>To-day, when the sun stood at such a height, I met one (or
several) persons traveling on foot</i>. If the travelers met were on horseback
he makes the sign for <i>horse</i> as described by (<i>Dakota</i> III), see
<span class="sc">Extracts from Dictionary</span>, or the identical one for <i>going</i> given by
(<i>Ojibwa</i> I),
which is as follows: To describe a journey on horseback the first two
fingers of the right hand are placed astride of the forefinger of the left
hand, and both represent the galloping movement of a horse. If it is a
foot journey, wave the two fingers several times through the air.</p>

<h2>NARRATIVES.</h2>

<p>The following, which is presented as a good descriptive model, was
obtained by Dr. <span class="sc">W.J. Hoffman</span>, of the Bureau of Ethnology, from
Natci, a Pai-Ute chief connected with the delegation of that tribe to
Washington in January, 1880, and refers to an expedition made by him
by direction of his father, Winnimukka, Head Chief of the Pai-Utes,
to the northern camp of his tribe, partly for the purpose of preventing
the hostile outbreak of the Banaks which occurred in 1878, and more
particularly to prevent those Pai-Utes from being drawn into any difficulty
with the United States by being leagued with the Banaks.</p>

<p>The above was paraphrased orally by the narrator as follows: "Hearing
of the trouble in the north, I started eastward from my camp in
Western Nevada, when, upon arriving at Winnemucca Station, I received
telegraphic orders from the head chief to go north to induce our
bands in that region to escape the approaching difficulties with the
Banaks. I started for Camp McDermit, where I remained one night.
Leaving next morning in company with nine others, we rode on for four
days and a half. Soon after our arrival at the Pai-Ute camp, two Banaks
came in, when I sent twelve Pai-Utes to their camp to ask them all to
come in to hold council. These messengers soon returned, when I collected
all the Pai-Utes ands talked to them all night regarding the dangers
of an alliance with the Banaks and of their continuance in that
locality. Next morning I sent my brother to the chief, Winnimukka,
with a report of proceedings.</p>

<p>"On the following day three white men rode into camp, who had come
up to aid in persuading the Pai-Utes to move away from the border.
Next morning I consulted with them respecting future operations, after
which they went away a short distance to their camp. I then followed
them, where I shot and killed a steer, and while skinning it the Banaks
came in, when the meat was distributed. The Banaks being disposed
to become violent at any moment, the white men became alarmed, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page504" id="page504"></a>[pg 504]</span>
I told them that rather than allow them to be scalped I would be scalped
myself in defending them, for which action I would be considered as
great a chief as Winnemukka by my people. When I told the Banaks
to cease threatening the white men they all moved to one side a short
distance to hold a war council, and after the sun went down the white
men and I mounted our horses and fled toward the south, whence we came."</p>

<p>Some of the above signs seem to require explanation. Natci was
facing the west during the whole of this narration, and by the right he
signified the north; this will explain the significance of his gesture to
the right in Nos. 11 and 17, and to the left in No. 75.</p>

<p>No. 2 (repeated in Nos. 22,27,33, and 41) designates an Indian brush
lodge, and although Natci has not occupied one for some years, the
gesture illustrates the original conception in the round form of the
foundation of poles, branches, and brush, the interlacing of which in
the construction of the <i>wik'-i-up</i> has survived in gestures Nos. 3
and 23 (the latter referring to more than one, <i>i.e.</i>, an encampment).</p>

<p>The sign for Banak, No. 25 (also 32 and 59), has its origin from the
tradition among the Pai-Utes that the Banaks were in the habit of cutting
the throats of their victims. This sign is made with the index
instead of the similar gesture with the flat hand, which among several
tribes denotes the Sioux, but the Pai-Utes examined had no specific
sign for that body of Indians, not having been in sufficient contact with
them.</p>

<p>"A stopping place," referred to in Nos. 6, 12, 52, and 54, represents
the temporary station, or camp of white men, and is contradistinguished
from a village, or perhaps from any permanent encampment of a number
of persons, by merely dotting toward the ground instead of indicating a
circle.</p>

<p>It will also be seen that in several instances, after indicating the
nationality, the fingers previously used in representing the number were
repeated without its previously accompanying specific gesture, as in
No. 61, where the three fingers of the left hand represented the men
(white), and the three movements toward the ground signified the camp
or tents of the three (white) men.</p>

<p>This also occurs in the gesture (Nos. 59, 60, and 71) employed for the
Banaks, which, having been once specified, is used subsequently without
its specific preceding sign for the tribe represented.</p>

<p>The rapid connection of the signs Nos. 57 and 58 and of Nos. 74 and
75 indicates the conjunction, so that they are severally readily understood
as "shot <i>and</i> killed," and "the white men <i>and</i> I." The same
remark applies to Nos. 15 and 16, "the nine <i>and</i> I."</p>

<h3><i>PATRICIO'S NARRATIVE.</i></h3>

<p>This narrative was obtained in July, 1880, by Dr. <span class="sc">Francis H. Atkins</span>,
acting assistant surgeon, United States Army, at South Fork, New
Mexico, from <span class="sc">Ti-pe-bes-tlel</span> (Sheepskin-leggings), habitually called
Patricio, an intelligent young Mescalero Apache. It gives an account
of what is locally termed the "April Round-up," which was the disarming
and imprisoning by a cavalry command of the United States Army,
of the small Apache subtribe to which the narrator belonged.</p>

<p>(1) Left hand on edge, curved, palm, forward, extended backward
length of arm toward the West (<i>far westward</i>).</p>

knee, and cut off with edges of hands (<i>boot tops</i>), (<i>Warm Spring
Apaches</i>, who wear booted moccasins with turn-up toes.)</p>

<p>(10) Placed first and second fingers of right hand, others closed,
astride of left index, held horizontally (<i>horses</i>).</p>

<p>(11) Held hands on edge and forward (T on edge forward), pushed
them forward, waving vertically (<i>marching</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>ran off with soldiers'
horses or others</i>). N.B.&mdash;Using both hands indicates double ranks of
troops marching also.</p>

<p>(12) Struck right fist across in front of chin from right to left sharply
(<i>bad</i>).</p>

<p>(13) Repeated No. 4 (<i>Warm Spring Apache</i>).</p>

<p>(19) Touched tent (<i>quite white</i>).</p>

<p>(20) Touched top of shoulder (<i>commissioned officer</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
shoulder-straps).</p>

<p>(21) Thrust both hands up high (<i>high rank</i>).</p>

<p>(22) Right forefinger to forehead; waved it about in front of face and
rolled head about (primarily <i>fool</i>, but qualified in this case by the
interpreter as <i>no sabe much</i>).</p>

<p>(23) Drew hands up his thighs and body and pointed to himself (<i>Mescalero
Indian</i>).</p>

<p>(24) Approximated hands before him, palms down, with thumbs and
indexes widely separated, as if inclosing a circle (<i>captured</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
<i>corralled, surrounded</i>).</p>

<p>(25) Placed tips of hands together, wrists apart, held them erect (T,
both hands inclined), (<i>house</i>; in this case <i>the agency</i>).</p>

from knuckles (metacarpo-phalangeal joint) only, several times (<i>issuing
rations</i>).</p>

<p>(33) Repeated No. 4, adding, swept indexes around head and touched
red paper on a tobacco wrapper (<i>San Carlos Apaches</i>, scouts
especially
distinguished by wearing a red fillet about the head); also added, drew
indexes across each cheek from nose outward (<i>were much painted</i>).</p>

<p>(46) Held hands in position of aiming a gun&mdash;left
oblique&mdash;(<i>shoot</i>).</p>

<p>(47) Waved right index briskly before right shoulder (<i>no, did not;
negation</i>).</p>

<p>(48) Swept his hand from behind forward, palm up (Y) (<i>the others
came</i>).</p>

<p>(49) Repeated No. 5 (<i>and shot</i>).</p>

<p>(50) Repeated No. 23 (<i>the Mescaleros</i>).</p>

left, and cast it toward earth over left shoulder (<i>brave</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>the San
Carlos scouts are brave</i>).</p>

<h4>CONTINUOUS TRANSLATION OF THE ABOVE.</h4>

<p>Far westward beyond the Rio Grande are the Warm Spring Apaches,
who killed many Mexicans and soldiers and stole their horses. They
(the Warm Spring Apaches) are bad and fools.</p>

<p>Some cavalry came here under an aged officer of high rank, but of inferior
intelligence, to capture the Mescalero Indians.</p>

<p>The Mescaleros wished to have their village permanently here by the
agency, and to receive their rations, <i>i.e.</i>, were peacefully inclined.</p>

<p>Our village was over there. I saw the general come with troops and
San Carlos scouts to surround (or capture) the Mescalero Indians.
There were a great many San Carlos scouts and soldiers.</p>

<p>I saw that my people were afraid, and half of them fled.</p>

<p>Next morning the Mescaleros did not shoot (were not hostile). The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page508" id="page508"></a>[pg 508]</span>
others came and killed many Mescaleros. The cavalry and infantry
brought us (the Mescaleros) to this camp as prisoners.</p>

<p>The San Carlos scouts were well supplied with ammunition and guns,
and shot many Warm Spring Indians and Mescaleros.</p>

<p>The San Carlos scouts are brave men.</p>


<h3><i>NA-WA-GI-JIG'S STORY.</i></h3>

<p>The following is contributed by Mr. <span class="sc">Francis Jacker</span>:</p>

<p>This narrative was related to me by <i>John Na-wa-gi-jig</i> (literally
"noon-day sky"), an aged Ojibwa, with whom I have been intimately connected
for a long period of years. He delivered his story, referring to one of
the many incidents in his perilous life, orally, but with pantomimes so
graphic and vivid that it may be presented truly as a specimen of gesture
language. Indeed, to any one familiar with Indian mimicry, the
story might have been intelligible without the expedient of verbal
language, while the oral exposition, incoherent as it was, could hardly be
styled anything better than the subordinate part of the delivery. I
have endeavored to reproduce these gestures in their original connections
from memory, omitting the verbal accompaniment as far as practicable.
In order to facilitate a clear understanding it is stated that the
gesturer was in a sitting posture before a camp fire by the lake shore,
and facing the locality where the event referred to had actually occurred,
viz, a portion of Keweenaw Bay, Lake Superior, in the neighborhood of
Portage Entry, as seen by the annexed diagram, Fig. 319. The time
of the relation (latter part of April) also coincided with the
<i>actual</i> time.
In speaking of "arm," "hand," "finger," &amp;c., the "right" is understood
if not otherwise specified. "Finger" stands for "forefinger."</p>

<p>(1) With the exclamation "<i>me-wi-ja</i>" (a long time ago), uttered in a
slow and peculiarly emphatic manner, he elevated the arm above and
toward the right at the head, accompanying the motion with an upward
wave of the hand and held it thus suspended a moment&mdash;<i>a long time
ago</i>.
(This gesture resembles sign for <i>time, a long</i>, of which it seems to
be an
abbreviation, and it is not sufficiently clear without the accompanying
exclamation.) Withdrawing it slowly, he placed the hand back upon
his knee.</p>

<p>(2) He then brought up the left hand toward the temple and tapped
his hair, which was gray, with the finger&mdash;<i>hair gray</i>.</p>

<p>(3) From thence he carried it down upon the thigh, placing the extended
finger perpendicularly upon a fold of his trousers, which the
thumb and finger of the right held grasped in such a manner as to
advantageously
present the smooth black surface of the cloth&mdash;<i>of that color</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, <i>black</i>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:55%;"><a href="images/fig319.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig319.png" alt="" /></a>Fig. 319&mdash;Scene of Na-wa-gi-jig's story.</div>

<p>(4) Next, with a powerful strain of the muscles, he slowly stretched
out the right arm and fist and grasping the arm about the elbow with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page509" id="page509"></a>[pg 509]</span>
the left, he raised the forearm perpendicularly upward, then brought it
down with force, tightening the grasp in doing so (fingers pressing upon
knuckle, thumb against pit of elbow)&mdash;<i>strength</i>.</p>

<p>(5) Pointing first at me&mdash;<i>you</i>.</p>

<p>(6) He next held out the hand horizontally and flat, palm downward,
about four feet above the ground, correcting the measure a moment
afterward by elevating hand a few inches higher, and estimated the
height thus indicated with a telling look, leaning the head toward the
side&mdash;<i>about that height</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>a youth of about that size</i>.</p>

<p>(7) He then rapidly extended the arm about two-thirds of its length
forward and toward the right, terminating the motion with a jerk of the
hand upward, palm turned outward, and accompanied the motion with
a nod of the head, the hand in its downfall closing and dropping upon
knee&mdash;<i>very well</i>.</p>

<p>(8) Musing a few moments, he next slowly extended the arm and
pointed with the fingers toward and along the surface of the
frozen bay&mdash;<i>out there</i>.</p>

<p>(9) In an easterly direction&mdash;<i>eastward</i>.</p>

<p>(10) Thence turning the arm to the right he nodded the finger toward
a projection of land southward at a distance of about two
miles&mdash;following
in each case the direction of the finger with the eyes&mdash;and immediately
after placed the hand again eastward, indicating the spot with the
same emphatic nod of the finger as though carrying the visible distance
to a spot upon the expanse of the bay, which, bearing no object, could
not be marked otherwise&mdash;<i>two miles out there</i>.</p>

<p>(11) Carrying the finger toward the body, he touched his breast&mdash;<i>I
myself</i>.</p>

<p>(12) Thence erected the hand, turning its palm forward, forefinger
perpendicularly extended, others slightly closed, and nodded it downward
in an explanatory manner, all in an uninterrupted
movement&mdash;<i>one</i>,
meaning in connection with the preceding gesture&mdash;<i>I for one</i>.</p>

<p>(13) Again, with an emphatic movement, he turned the hand upward,
slightly erecting the index, thumb pointing forward, remaining fingers
partially and naturally opened and more or less
separated&mdash;<i>furthermore</i>.</p>

<p>(14) Then quickly and after a moment's stop brought down the hand
to a horizontal position, first and second fingers joining and fully
extending
during the movement, and pointing forward&mdash;<i>another</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
<i>joined by another</i>. Repeating this motion, he at the same time called
out
the name <i>Ga-bi-wa-bi-ko-ke</i>.</p>

<p>(15) Following the exclamation with a repetition of No. 2&mdash;<i>gray
hair</i>&mdash;repeatedly
touching the hair, meaning in this case&mdash;<i>an old man</i>.</p>

<p>(16) Pointed with the finger toward the right, directing it obliquely
toward the ground&mdash;<i>at a short distance toward my right</i>.</p>

<p>(17) Repeated No. 13&mdash;<i>furthermore</i>.</p>

<p>(18) Repeated No. 14, adding the third finger to joined fore and middle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page510" id="page510"></a>[pg 510]</span>
fingers, thumb resting upon tip of fourth&mdash;<i>another</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>joined by a
third</i>, and pronounced the words "<i>o-gwis-san Sa-ba-dis</i>" (this is a
corruption
of the French "Jean Baptiste," a favorite name among Christianized
Indians)&mdash;<i>John Baptist, his son</i>, while repeating the movement.</p>

<p>(19) Held up the three separated fingers perpendicularly in front of
the face, pushing the hand forward a little&mdash;<i>three in all</i>.</p>

<p>(20) Presently lowered the hand, fingers relaxing, and carried it a
short distance toward the left, thence back to the right, fingers pointing
obliquely toward the ground in each case&mdash;<i>placed to the right and left
of me at a short distance</i>.</p>

<p>(21) He then brought the hand&mdash;back toward the right, index horizontally
extended, remaining fingers closed, thumb placed against second
finger&mdash;in front of abdomen, and moved it slowly up and down two
or three times, giving it a slight jerk at the upward motion, and raising
the arm partially in doing so. At the same time he inclined the body
forward a little, eyes looking down&mdash;<i>fishing</i>. This refers to fishing
on
the ice, and, as may be inferred from it, to the use of hook and line. A
short stick to which the line is attached serves as a rod and is moved
up and down in the manner described.</p>

<p>(22) After a short pause he elevated the hand, directing the index
toward that point of the meridian which the sun passes at about the
tenth hour of the day, and following the direction with, the eye&mdash;<i>about
ten o'clock</i>.</p>

<p>(23) Turning his face toward the southwest and holding up the flat
and extended hand some distance in front of it, back outward, he waved
it briskly and several times toward the face&mdash;<i>fresh breeze from the
southwest</i>.</p>

<p>(24) Repeated No. 21 (<i>fishing</i>), playing the imaginary fish-line up
and
down regularly for a while, till all at once he changed the movement by
raising the hand in an oblique course, which movement he repeated
several times, each time increasing the divergence and the length of
the motion&mdash;<i>the fish-hook don't sink perpendicularly any longer</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
<i>it is moving</i>.</p>

<p>(25) Quickly erecting his body he looked around him with
surprise&mdash;<i>looking with surprise</i>.</p>

<p>(26) Shading his eyes with the hand, gazed intensively toward the
south&mdash;<i>fixedly gazing toward the south</i>.</p>

<p>(27) Threw up his arm almost perpendicularly the next moment&mdash;<i>greatly
astonished</i>.</p>

<p>(28) Extended and slowly moved the arm from southeast to northwest
as far as he could reach, at the same time exclaiming "<i>mig-wam</i>"
"ice"&mdash;<i>the ice from shore to shore</i>.</p>

<p>(29) Approximated the flat and horizontally extended hands, backs
upward, with their inner edges touching, whereupon, suddenly turning
the edges downward, he withdrew them laterally, backs nearly opposed
to each other&mdash;<i>parting</i>.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page511" id="page511"></a>[pg 511]</span>

<p>(30) Pushed the left hand, palm outward, fingers joined, edges up and
down, forward and toward its side with a full sweep of the arm, head
following the movement&mdash;<i>pushed in that direction</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
<i>northeastward</i>.</p>

<p>(31) Repeated No. 23, but waved the hand only once and with a quick
and more powerful movement toward the face&mdash;<i>by the force of the
wind</i>.</p>

<p>(32) Rotated hands in front of body, rolling them tips over tips very
rapidly, fingers with thumbs nearly collected to a point&mdash;<i>winding up the
hook-line in a hurry</i>.</p>

<p>(33) Quickly passed the hand toward the left breast of his coat&mdash;<i>putting
it in pocket</i>.</p>

<p>(34) And bending the body forward made motion as if picking up
something&mdash;<i>picking up</i>.</p>

<p>(35) Raised the hand closed to fist, arm elevated so as to form a right
angle with elbow, and made a short stroke downward and toward the
left&mdash;<i>hatchet</i>.</p>

<p>(36) Thence moved the hand to side of breast and pushed it down the
waist&mdash;<i>putting it into belt</i>.</p>

<p>(37) Placed the closed hands to each side of the waist (thumbs upward
with tips facing each other) and approximated them rapidly and
with a jerk in front of navel&mdash;<i>tightening the belt</i>.</p>

<p>(38) With both hands lowered to the ground, he described an elongated
oval around his foot by placing tips of forefingers together in front of
the toes and passing them around each side, meeting the fingers behind
the heel and running them jointly backward a few inches to indicate a
tail&mdash;<i>snow-shoe</i>.</p>

<p>(39) Raised up the heel, resting the foot on the toes and turning it
a little toward the right, brought it back in a downward movement with
a jerk&mdash;<i>putting it on</i>.</p>

<p>(40) Waved the left hand emphatically forward, palm backward, fingers
joined and pointing downward, extending them forward at termination
of motion, at the same time pushing forward the head&mdash;<i>starting</i>.</p>

<p>(41) Directed the finger of the same hand toward the light-house&mdash;<i>toward
that point</i>.</p>

<p>(42) Pointed with extended first two fingers of the same hand, thumb
with remaining fingers partially extended to right and to
left&mdash;<i>companions</i>.</p>

<p>(43) Repeated No. 40 (<i>starting</i>) less emphatically.</p>

<p>(44) Made several very quick jumping movements forward with the
extended left fingers, joined, back upward&mdash;<i>going very fast</i>.</p>

<p>(45) Repeated No. 23 (<i>wind</i>), increasing the force of the movement
and terminating the sign with the second repetition (wave)&mdash;<i>wind
increasing</i>.</p>

<p>(46) Raised up the hand in front of head and then arrested it a moment,
palm outward, fingers extended, upward and forward&mdash;<i>halt</i>.</p>

<p>(47) Partially turning the body toward the north he lowered the extended
hand, back forward, fingers joined and pointing downward toward
the left of his feet and moved it closely in front of them, and with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page512" id="page512"></a>[pg 512]</span>
a cutting motion, toward the right, following the movement with the
eye&mdash;<i>cut off right before feet</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>standing on the very edge</i>.</p>

<p>(48) Still facing the north, he carried the hand, back upward, fingers
joined and extended, from left side of body outward and toward the
right horizontally, indicating the rippled surface of turbulent water by
an appropriate motion, and extending the arm to full length, fingers
pointing northeastward (toward the right) at termination of motion, and
accompanied the movement with a corresponding turn of the head, eyes
gazing far into distance&mdash;<i>water all along the shore</i>.</p>

<p>(49) Pushed the extended finger, back upward, forward (<i>i.e.</i>,
northward)
in a slightly arched movement&mdash;<i>across</i>.</p>

hundred yards the next moment&mdash;<i>a distance of about one hundred
yards</i>.</p>

motion&mdash;<i>that distance placed across</i>.</p>

<p>(52) Motions as follows: Hands naturally relaxed, edges up and
down, backs outward, are with a quick movement and simultaneously
carried from the epigastrium forward and toward their sides, arms being
extended from elbows only. The hands change their position during
the movement and are ultimately placed palms upward, thumbs and fingers
extended and widely separated, pointing forward. This is the
general sign for <i>doubt</i>. He also turned the face from one side to the
other as though interrogating his companions&mdash;<i>what are we to do</i>?</p>

<p>(53) Repeated No. 35 (<i>hatchet</i>).</p>

resting against second, and emphatically inclined it forward&mdash;<i>only
one</i>.</p>

relaxed, back obliquely upward, inclining the face sideward with a look
of consternation, simultaneously, and again mechanically lowered it,
dropping palm of hand heavily upon the knee&mdash;"<i>bad fix</i>."</p>

<p>(56) Placed the hand to his hip and raised it up, closed to fist, by a
rapid and very energetic movement, ejaculating <i>haw!&mdash;quick to the
work</i> (referring to the ax or hatchet).</p>

<p>(57) Turning the body downward, he passed the hand, with forefinger
directed toward the ground, forward, sideward, and backward, in three
movements, each time turning at a right angle&mdash;<i>measuring off a square
piece on the ground</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>on the ice</i>.</p>

<p>(58) Looked and pointed toward an object some twenty feet off, then
opposed palms of hands horizontally, and at a short distance from each
other, connecting both movements in such a manner as to clearly illustrate
their meaning&mdash;<i>about twenty feet wide</i>.</p>

<p>(59) Moved the hand&mdash;fist, thumb upward&mdash;several times quickly up
and down a few inches, the arm progressing forward at every
stroke&mdash;<i>cutting it off</i>.</p>

<p>(60) Repeated No. 55 (<i>bad fix</i>), meaning in this case&mdash;<i>bad
job</i>.</p>

<p>(61) Opposed the palms of both hands, vertically, at a distance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page513" id="page513"></a>[pg 513]</span>
eight inches, holding them thus steady a moment and estimating the
thus indicated measure with the eyes&mdash;<i>eight inches thick</i>.</p>

forcibly&mdash;<i>solid ice</i>.</p>

<p>(63) Laid the joined and extended first two fingers, palm up, across
side of leg, a foot above heel, accompanying the movement with the
eye&mdash;<i>one foot deep</i>.</p>

extended hand&mdash;<i>sinking</i>, or <i>giving in</i>&mdash;and turning the hand
upward at wrist, back downward, he flirted up the fingers several times
quickly&mdash;<i>water&mdash;slush and water</i>.</p>

<p>(65) Passed one hand over the other as in the act of pulling off
mittens&mdash;<i>mittens</i>.</p>

<p>(66) Made the motion of wringing out a wet piece of cloth&mdash;<i>wringing
wet</i>.</p>

<p>(67) Grasped a fold of his trowsers (below the knee) and wrung
it&mdash;<i>trowsers also wet</i>.</p>

<p>(68) Placed palms of both hands upon legs, near to the ankles, and
dragged them up to the knees&mdash;<i>up to the knees</i>.</p>

<p>(69) Shivered&mdash;<i>feeling cold</i>.</p>

<p>(72) Repeated No. 59 (<i>cutting the ice</i>).</p>

<p>(73) Made sign for <i>tired&mdash;getting tired</i>, as follows: The left arm is
partly extended forward, and is gently struck near the bend of the
elbow, usually above it, with the palm of the right hand, at the same time
the head is usually inclined to the left side, then in similar manner the
right arm is extended and struck by the left hand, and the head in turn
inclined to the right.</p>

<p>(74) Repeated No. 35&mdash;(<i>hatchet</i>).</p>

<p>(75) Turned the slightly closed left (thumb obliquely upward) over
to its side, partially opening it in so doing, fingers pointing to

<p>(77) Repeated No. 59 (<i>cutting the ice</i>).</p>

<p>(78) Elevated the hand above head, thumb and first two fingers extended
and directed toward the western meridian, and shook it emphatically
and with a tremulous motion up and down while thus suspended&mdash;<i>at
a late hour</i>.</p>

<p>(79) Followed with the sign for <i>done, finished</i>, as follows: Left
hand,
with forearm horizontally extended toward the right, is held naturally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page514" id="page514"></a>[pg 514]</span>
relaxed, back outward, a few inches in front of body and at a right angle
with opposite hand, which is placed on a higher level, slightly arched,
edge downward, fingers joined and extended forward. Pass the right
quickly and with a cutting motion downward and toward its side, at
the same time withdraw the left a few inches toward the opposite
direction&mdash;<i>finished our work</i>.</p>

<p>(80) Quickly threw up his arm, ejaculating "haw!"&mdash;<i>let us start</i>.</p>

<p>(81) Passed both hands approximated in front of body, naturally relaxed,
backs outward, forward and toward their respective sides, extending
and widely separating the fingers during the movement, and
again approximating them with quickly accelerated speed and arresting
them, closed to fists, in front of body and with a jerk upward&mdash;<i>with
united efforts</i>.</p>

<p>(82) Placing the fists, thumbs upward, pointing forward and placed

them forward and downward a few inches, head slightly participating
in the movement&mdash;<i>pushing off</i>.</p>

<p>(83) Repeated No. 38 (<i>snow-shoe)&mdash;with snow-shoes</i>.</p>

<p>(84) Immediately reassumed the position of "pushing off" as in No.
82, slowly passing forward the fists further and further&mdash;<i>pushing and
gradually moving off</i>.</p>

<p>(85) Quickly passed and turned the closed left forward, upward, and
backward, opening and again closing the fingers in so doing, and executing
at almost the same instant a similar, but smaller, revolution with
the right&mdash;<i>turning over the snow-shoe, tail up</i>.</p>

<p>(86) With both hands closed to fists, left obliquely over the right and
on the right side of the body, made motion as if paddling&mdash;<i>paddling</i>.</p>

off the hook-line</i>.</p>

<p>(93) Approximated both hands with their tips horizontally in front of
body, first two fingers with thumb collected to a point, and moving the
fingers as in the act of twisting a cord, gradually receded the

<p>(94) Thrust forward three fingers of the right&mdash;<i>three</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
<i>hook-lines</i>.</p>

forward over the thigh repeatedly and with a slight pressure&mdash;<i>twisting
them tightly</i>.</p>

<p>(96) Approximated both hands closed to fists, thumbs upward, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page515" id="page515"></a>[pg 515]</span>
front of body and pulled them asunder repeatedly by short, quick, and
sudden jerks&mdash;<i>proving strength of line</i>.</p>

in an oblique direction, fore and middle fingers extended and
joined with the thumb&mdash;<i>sinking</i>.</p>

and toward their respective sides a short distance, turning the palms
upward during the movement, thumb and fingers being extended and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page516" id="page516"></a>[pg 516]</span>

hand, at the same time pushing the left&mdash;bent downward at wrist, palm
backward&mdash;forward in that direction, arm fully extended, fingers separated
and pointing ahead at termination of motion&mdash;<i>out there at a great
distance</i>.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page517" id="page517"></a>[pg 517]</span>

<p>(133) Pointing toward the sun first, he placed palms of both hands in

<p>(134) Made three vigorous strokes with the imaginary paddle&mdash;<i>three
more paddle-strokes</i>.</p>

<p>(135) Moved both hands (flat and extended, backs upward) evenly

hands almost perpendicularly upward at wrist, thus arresting them
suddenly&mdash;<i>the ice-raft runs up against the shore</i>.</p>

<p>(136) Lastly threw up the hand perpendicularly above head, and
bringing it down, placed the palm gently over the heart with an air of
solemnity&mdash;<i>we are saved</i>.</p>

<p><i>Free translation of the story</i>.</p>

<p>Many years ago&mdash;my hair, then black and smooth, has since turned
gray; I was then in the prime of life; you, I suppose, were a young lad
at that time&mdash;the following incident occurred to me:</p>

<p>Yonder on the ice, two miles eastward, I was one day fishing in company
with two others, the old Gabiwabikoke and his son John Baptist.
It was about ten o'clock in the morning&mdash;a fresh breeze from the southwest
had previously been getting up&mdash;when the hook-line which I was
playing up and down began to take an oblique course as though it were
moved by a current. Surprised, I looked up and around me. When
glancing toward the south I saw a dark streak stretching from shore to
shore across the bay; the ice had parted and the wind was carrying it
out toward the open lake. In an instant I had wound up my hook-line,
picked up my hatchet and snow-shoes, which I put on my feet, and
hurried&mdash;the others following my example&mdash;toward the nearest point of
land, yonder where the light-house stands. The wind was increasing
and we traveled as fast as we could. There we arrived at the very edge
of the ice, a streak of water about one hundred yards in width extending
northward along the shore as far as we could see. What to begin
with, nothing but a single hatchet? We were in a bad situation. Well,
something had to be done. I measured off a square piece on the ice and
began cutting it off with the hatchet, a hard and tedious labor. The ice
was only eight inches thick, but slush and water covered it to the depth
of a foot. I soon had my mittens and trowsers wringing wet and began
to feel cold and tired. The old Gabiwabikoke was in a worse state than
I. His son next took the hatchet and we all worked by turns. It was
about two o'clock in the afternoon when we finished our work. With
the help of our snow-shoes (stemming their tail-ends against the edge
of the solid ice), we succeeded in pushing off our raft. Turning our
snow-shoes the other way (using their tails as handles), we commenced
paddling with them toward the shore. It was a very slow progress, as
the wind drifted us outward continually. John Baptist managed to twist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page518" id="page518"></a>[pg 518]</span>
our three hook-lines into a strong cord, and tying the hooks together in
the shape of an anchor, he threw it out toward the shore. Hauling in
the line the hooks dragged over the smooth rock bottom and would not
catch. Repeated trials were of no avail. We all resumed our former
attempt and paddled away with increased energy. The day was drawing
near its close, and we began to feel the cold more bitterly. Gabiwabikoke
was suffering badly from its effects and was entirely played
out. We had already drifted more than a mile beyond the light-house
point. John Baptist and I continued paddling steadily and vigorously,
and felt relieved and encouraged when we saw the shore draw near and
nearer. The ice-field, by this time, was miles away to the northeast,
and a sea was getting up. At last, just when the sun was setting, only
a few yards separated us from the shore; three more paddle-strokes and
our raft ran up against the beach. We were safe.</p>

<h2>DISCOURSES.</h2>


<h3><i>ADDRESS OF KIN CH&#274;-&#276;SS.</i></h3>


<div class="figright" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/fig320.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig320.png" alt="We are friends. Wichita" /></a>Fig. 320.</div>

<p>The following is the farewell address of <span class="sc">Kin Ch&#275;-&#277;ss</span> (Spectacles),
medicine-man of the Wichitas, to Rev. <span class="sc">A.J. Holt</span>, missionary, on his
departure from the Wichita Agency, in the words of the latter:</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:54%;"><a href="images/fig321.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig321.png" alt="Talk, talking. Wichita" /></a>Fig. 321.</div>

<p>He placed one hand on my breast, the other on his own, then clasped
his two hands together after the manner of our congratulations&mdash;<i>We
are friends</i>, Fig. 320. He placed one hand on me, the other on himself,
then placed the first two fingers of his right
hand between his lips&mdash;<i>We are brothers</i>. He
placed his right hand over my heart, his left
hand over his own heart, then linked the first
fingers of his right and left hands&mdash;<i>Our hearts
are linked together</i>. See Fig. 232, p. <a href="#page386">386</a>. He laid his right hand on
me lightly, then put it to his mouth, with the knuckles lightly against
his lips, and made the motion of flipping water from the right-hand
forefinger, each flip casting the hand and arm from the mouth a foot or so,
then bringing it back in the same position. (This repeated three or
more times, signifying <i>talk</i> or <i>talking</i>.) Fig. 321. He then
made a motion with his right hand as if
he were fanning his right ear; this repeated. He then extended
his right hand with his index finger pointing upward,
his eyes also being turned upward&mdash;<i>You told me of the Great
Father</i>. Pointing to himself, he hugged both hands to his bosom,
as if he were affectionately clasping something he loved, and then
pointed upward in the way before described&mdash;<i>I love him</i> (the Great
Father). Laying his right hand on me, he clasped his
hands to his bosom as before&mdash;<i>I love you</i>. Placing his
right hand on my shoulder, he threw it over his own right
shoulder as if he were casting behind him a little chip,
only when his hand was over his shoulder his index
finger was pointing behind him&mdash;<i>You go away</i>. Pointing
to his breast, he clinched the same hand as if it held a
stick, and made a motion as if he were trying to strike
something on the ground with the bottom of the stick
held in an upright position&mdash;<i>I stay, or I stay right here</i>, Fig. 322.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:20%;"><a href="images/fig322.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig322.png" alt="I stay, or I stay right here. Wichita" /></a>Fig. 322.</div>

<p>Placing his right hand on me, he placed both his hands on his breast
and breathed deeply two or three times, then using the index finger and
thumb of each hand as if he were holding a small pin, he placed the
two hands in this position as if he were holding a thread in each hand
and between the thumb and forefinger of each hand close together, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page522" id="page522"></a>[pg 522]</span>
then let his hands recede from each other, still holding his fingers in
the same position, as if he were letting a thread slip between them until
his hands were two feet apart&mdash;<i>You live long time</i>, Fig. 323. Laying
his right hand on his breast, then extending his forefinger of the same
hand, holding it from him at half-arm's length, the finger pointing nearly
upward, then moving his hand, with the finger thus extended, from side
to side about as rapidly as a man steps in walking, each time letting
his hand get farther from him for three or four times, then suddenly
placing his left hand in a horizontal position with the fingers extended
and together so that the palm was sidewise, he used the right-hand palm,
extended, fingers together, as a hatchet, and brought it down smartly,
just missing the ends of the fingers of the left hand, Fig. 324. Then
placing his left hand, with the thumb
and forefinger closed, to his heart,
he brought his right hand, fingers in
the same position, to his left; then, as
if he were holding something between
his thumb and forefinger, he moved his
right hand away as if he were slowly
casting a hair from him, his left hand
remaining at his breast, and his eyes
following his right&mdash;<i>I go about a little while longer, but will be cut
off shortly
and my spirit will go away</i> (or will die). Placing the thumbs and
forefingers
again in such a position as if he held a small thread between
the thumb and forefinger of each hand, and the hands touching each
other, he drew his hands slowly from each other, as if he were stretching
a piece of gum-elastic; then laying his right hand on me, he extended
the left hand in a horizontal position, fingers extended and closed, and
brought down his right hand with fingers extended and together, so as
to just miss the tips of the fingers of his left hand; then placing his
left forefinger and thumb against his heart, he acted as if he took a
hair from the forefinger and thumb of his left hand with the forefinger
and thumb of the right, and slowly cast it from him, only letting his
left hand remain at his breast, and let the index finger of the right hand
point outward toward the distant horizon&mdash;<i>After a long time you die</i>.
When placing his left hand upon himself and his right hand upon me,
he extended them upward over his head and clasped them there&mdash;<i>We
then meet in heaven</i>. Pointing upward, then to himself, then to me, he
closed the third and little finger of his right hand, laying his thumb
over them, then extending his first and second fingers about as far apart
as the eyes, he brought his hand to his eyes, fingers pointing outward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page523" id="page523"></a>[pg 523]</span>
and shot his hand outward&mdash;<i>I see you up there</i>. Pointing to me, then
giving the last above-described sign of <i>look</i>, then pointing to
himself,
he made the sign as if stretching out a piece of gum-elastic between the
fingers of his left and right hands, and then made the sign of
<i>cut-off</i>
before described, and then extended the palm of the right hand horizontally
a foot from his waist, inside downward, then suddenly threw
it half over and from him, as if you were to toss a chip from the back
of the hand (this is the negative sign everywhere used among these
Indians)&mdash;<i>I
would see him a long time, which should never be cut off</i>, <i>i.e.</i>,
<i>always.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:90%;"><a href="images/fig323.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig323.png" alt="A long time. Wichita" /></a>Fig. 323.</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width:45%;"><a href="images/fig324.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig324.png" alt="Done, finished. Wichita" /></a>Fig. 324.</div>

<p>Pointing upward, then rubbing the back of his left hand lightly with
the forefinger of his right, he again gave the negative sign.&mdash;<i>No Indian
there</i> (in heaven). Pointing upward, then rubbing his forefinger over
the
back of my hand, he again made the negative sign&mdash;<i>No white man
there</i>.
He made the same sign again, only he felt his hair with the forefinger
and thumb of his right hand, rolling the hair several times between
the fingers&mdash;<i>No black man in heaven</i>. Then rubbing the back of his
hand
and making the negative sign, rubbing the back of my hand and making
the negative sign, feeling of one of his hairs with the thumb and
forefinger of his right hand, and making the negative sign, then using
both hands as if he were reaching around a hogshead, he brought the
forefinger of his right hand to the front in an upright position after
their manner of counting, and said thereby&mdash;<i>No Indian, no white man, no
black man, all one</i>. Making the "hogshead" sign, and that for
<i>look</i>,
he placed the forefinger of each hand side by side pointing upward&mdash;<i>All
look the same</i>, or alike. Running his hands over his wild Indian costume
and over my clothes, he made the "hogshead" sign, and that
for <i>same</i>, and said thereby&mdash;<i>All dress alike there</i>. Then
making the
"hogshead" sign, and that for <i>love</i>, (hugging his hands), he extended
both hands outward, palms turned downward, and made a sign exactly
similar to the way ladies smooth a bed in making it; this is the sign for
<i>happy&mdash;All will be happy alike there</i>. He then made the sign for
<i>talk</i>
and for <i>Father</i>, pointing to himself and to me&mdash;<i>You pray for
me</i>. He
then made the sign for <i>go away</i>, pointing to me, he threw right hand
over his right shoulder so his index finger pointed behind him&mdash;<i>You go
away</i>. Calling his name he made the sign for <i>look</i> and the sign of
<i>negation</i>
after pointing to me&mdash;<i>Kin Ch&#275;-&#277;ss see you no more</i>.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:25%;"><a href="images/fig325.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig325.png" alt="Sit down. Australian" /></a>Fig. 325.</div>

<p>Fig. 322, an illustration in the preceding address, also represents a
common gesture for <i>sit down</i>, if made to the right of the hip, toward
the locality to be occupied by the individual invited.
The latter closely corresponds to an Australian gesture
described by Smyth (<i>The Aborigines of Victoria,
London</i>, 1878, Vol. II, p. 308, Fig. 260), as follows:
"<i>Minnie-minnie</i> (wait a little). It is shaken downwards
rapidly two or three times. Done more slowly towards the ground,
it means 'Sitdown.'" This is reproduced in Fig. 325.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page524" id="page524"></a>[pg 524]</span>


<h3><i>TSO-DI-A'-KO'S REPORT.</i></h3>

<p>The following statement was made to Dr. <span class="sc">W.J. Hoffman</span> by <span class="sc">Tso-di-a'-ko</span>
(Shaved-head Boy), chief of the Wichitas in Indian Territory,
while on a visit to Washington, D.C., in June 1880.</p>

<p>The Indian being asked whether there was any timber in his part of
the Territory, replied in signs as follows:</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:55%;"><a href="images/fig326.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig326.png" alt="Cut down. Wichita" /></a>Fig. 326.</div>

<p>(1) Move the right hand, fingers loosely extended, separated and
pointing upward, back to the front, upward from the height of the waist
to the front of the face&mdash;<i>tree</i> (for illustration see Fig. 112, p.
<a href="#page343">343</a>); repeat
this two or three times&mdash;<i>trees</i>; (2) then hold the hand, fingers
extended
and joined, pointing upward, with the back to the front, and push it
forward
toward different points on a level with the face-<i>standing at various
places</i>; (3) both hands, with spread and slightly curved fingers, are
held
about two feet apart, before the thighs, palms facing, then draw them
toward one another horizontally and gradually upward until the wrists
cross, as if grasping a bunch of grass and pulling it up&mdash;<i>many</i>; (4)
point to the southwest with the index, elevating it a little above the
horizon&mdash;<i>country</i>;
(5) then throw the fist edgewise toward the surface, in that
direction&mdash;<i>my,
mine</i>; (6) place both hands, extended, flat, edgewise before the
body, the left below the right, and both edges pointing toward the ground
a short distance to the left of the body, then make repeated cuts toward
that direction from different points, the termination of each cut ending
at nearly the same point&mdash;<i>cut down</i>, Fig. 326; (7) hold the left hand
with the fingers and thumb collected to a point, directed horizontally
forward, and make several cutting motions with the
edge of the flat right hand transversely by the tips of the left,
and upon the wrist&mdash;<i>cut off the ends</i>; (8) then cut upon the left
hand, still held in the same position, with the right, the cuts
being parallel to the longitudinal axis of the palm&mdash;<i>split</i>; (9) both
hands closed in front of the body, about four inches apart,
with forefingers and thumbs approximating half circles, palms toward
the ground, move them forward so that the back of the hand
comes forward and the half circles imitate the movement of
wheels&mdash;<i>wagon</i>,
Fig. 327; (10) hold the left flat hand before the body, pointing
horizontally forward, with the palm down, then bring the right flat hand
from the right side and slap the palm upon the back of the left several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page525" id="page525"></a>[pg 525]</span>
times&mdash;<i>load</i>, upon, Fig. 328; (11) partly close the right hand as if
grasping
a thick rod, palm toward the ground, and push it straight forward
nearly to arm's length&mdash;<i>take</i>; (12) hold both hands with fingers
naturally
extended and slightly separated nearly at arm's length before the
body, palms down, the right lying upon the left, then pass the upper
forward and downward from the left quickly, so that the wrist of the
right is raised and the fingers point earthward&mdash;<i>throw off</i>; (13) cut
the
left palm repeatedly with the outer edge of the extended right
hand&mdash;<i>build</i>;
(14) hold both hands edgewise before the body, palms facing,
spread the fingers and place those of one hand into the spaces between
those of the left, so that the tips of one protrude beyond the backs of
the fingers of the other&mdash;<i>log house</i>, see Fig. 253, p. <a href="#page428">428</a>; (15) then
place
the flat right hand, palm down and fingers pointing to the left, against
the breast and move it forward, and slightly upward and to the
right&mdash;<i>good</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Notes</span>.&mdash;As will be seen, the word <i>timber</i> is composed of signs No. 1
and 2, signifying trees standing. Sign No. 3, for <i>many</i>, in this
instance,
as in similar other examples, becomes <i>much</i>. The word "in," in
connection
with <i>country</i> and <i>my</i>, is expressed by the gesture of pointing
(passing
the hand less quickly than in ordinary sign language) before making sign
No. 5. That sign commonly given for <i>possession</i>, would, without
the prefix of indication, imply <i>my country</i>, and with that prefix
signifies
<i>in my country</i>. Sign No. 7, <i>trimmed</i>, is indicated by chopping
off the ends,
and facial expression denoting <i>satisfaction</i>. In sign Nos. 11 and 12
the
gestures were continuous, but at the termination of the latter the narrator
straightened himself somewhat, denoting that he had overcome the
greater part of the labor. Sign No. 14 denotes <i>log-house</i>, from the
manner
of interlacing the finger-ends, thus representing the corner of a
log-house,
and the arrangement of the ends of the same. <i>Indian lodge</i>
would be indicated by another sign, although the latter is often used as
an abbreviation for the former, when the subject of conversation is
known to all present.</p>

<h3><i>LEAN WOLF'S COMPLAINT</i></h3>

<p>The following remarks were obtained by Dr. <span class="sc">W.J. Hoffman</span> from
<span class="sc">Tce-caq-a-daq-a-qic</span> (Lean Wolf), chief of the Hidatsa Indians of Dakota
Territory, who visited Washington in 1880:</p>

<p><span class="sc">Four years ago the American people agreed to be friends
with us, but they lied. That is all.</span></p>

<p>(1) Place the closed hand, with the thumb resting over the middle
of the index, on the left side of the forehead, palmar side down, then
draw the thumb across the forehead to the right, a short distance beyond
the head&mdash;<i>white man</i>, American, Fig. 329.</p>

<h2>SIGNALS.</h2>


<p>The collaborators in the work above explained have not generally responded
to the request to communicate material under this head. It is,
however, hoped that by now printing some extracts from published
works and the few contributions recently procured, the attention of
observers
will be directed to the prosecution of research in this direction.</p>

<p>The term "signal" is here used in distinction from the signs noted in
the <span class="sc">Dictionary</span>, extracts from which are given above, as being some
action or manifestation intended to be seen at a distance, and not allowing
of the minuteness or detail possible in close converse. Signals may
be executed, first, exclusively by bodily action; second, by action of the
person in connection with objects, such as a blanket, or a lance, or the
direction imparted to a horse; third, by various devices, such as smoke,
fire or dust, when the person of the signalist is not visible. When
not simply intended to attract attention they are generally conventional,
and while their study has not the same kind of importance as
that of gesture signs, it possesses some peculiar interest.</p>




<h2>SIGNALS EXECUTED BY BODILY ACTION.</h2>


<p>Some of these are identical, or nearly so, with the gesture signs used
by the same people.</p>

<h5>ALARM. See <span class="sc">Notes on Cheyenne and Arapaho signals</span>, <i>infra</i>.</h5>

<h5>ANGER.</h5>

<p>Close the hand, place it against the forehead, and turn it back and
forth while in that position. (Col. R.B. Marcy, U.S.A., <i>Thirty Years
of Army Life on the Border</i>, <i>New York</i>, 1866, p. 34.)</p>

<h5>COME HERE.</h5>

<p>The right hand is to be advanced about eighteen inches at the height
of the navel, horizontal, relaxed, palm downward, thumb in the palm;
then draw it near the side and at the same time drop the hand to bring
the palm backward. The farther away the person called is, the higher
the hand is raised. If very far off, the hand is raised high up over the
head and then swung forward, downward, and backward to the side.
(<i>Dakota</i> I, IV.)</p>

<h5>DANGER.</h5>

<p><i>There is something dangerous in that place.</i>&mdash;Right-hand index-finger
and thumb forming a curve, the other fingers closed; move the right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page530" id="page530"></a>[pg 530]</span>
hand forward, pointing in the direction of the dangerous place or animal.
(<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<h5>DEFIANCE.</h5>

<p>Right-hand index and middle fingers open; motion to ward the enemy
signifies "I do not fear you." Reverse the motion, bringing the hand
toward the subject, means "Do your worst to me." (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<h5>DIRECTION.</h5>

<p><i>Pass around that object or place near you</i>&mdash;she-&#237;-he ti-dh&#225;-ga.&mdash;When
a man is at a distance, I say to him "Go around that way." Describe
a curve by raising the hand above the head, forefinger open, move to
right or left according to direction intended and hand that is used, <i>i.e.</i>,
move to the left, use right hand; move to the right, use left hand.
(<i>Omaha</i> I; <i>Ponka</i> I.)</p>

<h5>HALT!</h5>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; To inquire disposition.</p>

<p>Raise the right hand with the palm in front and gradually push it
forward and back several times; if they are not hostile it will at once
be obeyed. (Randolph B. Marcy, <i>The Prairie Traveler</i>. <i>New York</i>, 1859,
p. 214.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Stand there! He is coming to you.</p>

<p>Right hand extended, flat, edgewise, moved downward several times.
(<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Stand there! He is going toward you.</p>

<p>Hold the open right hand, palm to the left, with the tips of the fingers
toward the person signaled to; thrust the hand forward in either an
upward or downward curve. (<i>Omaha</i> I; <i>Ponka</i> I.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Lie down flat where you are&mdash;she-dhu bis-p&#233; zha<sup>n</sup>'-ga.</p>

<p>Extend the right arm in the direction of the person signaled to, having
the palm down; move downward by degrees to about the knees. (<i>Omaha</i>
I; <i>Ponka</i> I.)</p>

<h5>PEACE; FRIENDSHIP.</h5>

<p>Hold up palm of hand.&mdash;Observed as made by an Indian of the Kansas
tribe in 1833. (John T. Irving, <i>Indian Sketches</i>. <i>Philadelphia</i>, 1835,
vol. ii, p. 253.)</p>

<p>Elevate the extended hands at arm's length above and on either side
of the head. Observed by Dr. W.J. Hoffman, as made in Northern
Arizona in 1871 by the Apaches, Mojaves, Hualpais, and Seviches.
"No arms"&mdash;corresponding with "hands up" of road-agents. Fig. 335.</p>

<p>The right hand held aloft, empty. (General G.A. Custer, <i>My Life on

<p>Toward all</p>
<p>I raise high the perpendicular hand,&mdash;I make the signal.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The Natchez in 1682 made signals of friendship to La Salle's party by
the joining of the two hands of the signalist, much embarrassing Tonty,
La Salle's lieutenant, in command of the advance in the descent of the
Mississippi, who could not return the signal, having but one hand.
His men responded in his stead. (Margry, <i>Decouvertes et &#201;tablissments
des Fran&#231;ais dans l'ouest et dans le sud de l'Am&#233;rique Septentrionale,
&amp;c.</i>)</p>

<h5>QUESTION.</h5>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; I do not know you. Who are you?</p>

<p>After halting a party coming: Right hand raised, palm in front and
slowly moved to the right and left. [Answered by tribal sign.] (Marcy's
<i>Prairie Traveler</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, 214.) Fig. 336. In this illustration
the answer
is made by giving the tribal sign for Pani.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; To inquire if coming party is peaceful.</p>

<p>Raise both hands, grasped in the manner of shaking hands, or by locking
the two forefingers firmly while the hands are held up. If friendly
they will respond with the same signal. (Marcy's <i>Prairie Traveler</i>, <i>loc.
cit.</i>, 214.)</p>

<h5>SUBMISSION.</h5>

<p>The United States steamer Saranac in 1874, cruising in Alaskan waters,
dropped anchor in July, 1874, in Freshwater Harbor, back of Sitka, in
latitude 59&#176; north. An armed party landed at a T'linkit village,
deserted by all the inhabitants except one old man and two women, the
latter seated at the feet of the former. The man was in great fear,
turned his back and held up his hands as a sign of utter helplessness.
(Extract from notes kindly furnished by Lieutenant-Commander <span class="sc">Wm.
Bainbridge Hoff</span>, U.S.N., who was senior aid to Rear-Admiral Pennock,
on the cruise mentioned.)</p>

<h5>SURRENDER.</h5>

<p>The palm of the hand is held toward the person [to whom the surrender
is made]. (<i>Long</i>.)</p>

<p>Hold the palm of the hand toward the person as high above the head
as the arm can be raised. (<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<h2>SIGNALS IN WHICH OBJECTS ARE USED IN CONNECTION WITH PERSONAL ACTION.</h2>


<h5>BUFFALO DISCOVERED. See also <span class="sc">Notes on Cheyenne and Arapaho signals</span>.</h5>

<p>When the Ponkas or Omahas discover buffalo the watcher stands
erect on the hill, with his face toward the camp, holding his blanket
with an end in each hand, his arms being stretched out (right and left)
on a line with, shoulders. (<i>Dakota</i> VIII; <i>Omaha</i> I;
<i>Ponka</i> I.) See Fig. 337.</p>

<p>Same as (<i>Omaha</i> I), and (<i>Ponka</i> I); with the addition that
after the
blanket is held out at arm's length the arms are crossed in front of the
body. (<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<h5>CAMP!</h5>

<p>When it is intended to encamp, a blanket is elevated upon a pole so
as to be visible to all the individuals of a moving party. (<i>Dakota</i>
VIII.)</p>

<h5>COME! TO BECKON TO A PERSON.</h5>

<p>Hold out the lower edge of the robe or blanket, then wave it in to the
legs. This is made when there is a desire to avoid general observation.
(<i>Matthews</i>.)</p>

<h5>COME BACK!</h5>

<p>Gather or grasp the left side of the unbuttoned coat (or blanket) with
the right hand, and, either standing or sitting in position so that the
signal can be seen, wave it to the left and right as often as may be
necessary
for the sign to be recognized. When made standing the person
should not move his body. (<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<h5>DANGER. See also <span class="sc">Notes on Cheyenne and Arapaho signals</span>.</h5>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Horseman at a distance, galloping, passing and repassing, and
crossing each other&mdash;<i>enemy comes</i>. But for notice of herd of buffalo,
they gallop back and forward abreast&mdash;do not cross each other. (H.M.
Brackenridge's <i>Views of Louisiana</i>. <i>Pittsburgh</i>, 1814, p. 250.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Riding rapidly round in a circle, "Danger! Get together as
quickly as possible." (Richard Irving Dodge, lieutenant-colonel United
States Army, <i>The Plains of the Great West</i>. <i>New York</i>, 1877, p. 368.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Point the right index in the direction of the danger, and then
throw the arm over the front of the body diagonally, so that the hand
rests near the left shoulder, back outward. If the person to be notified
of the danger should be in the rear precede the above signal with that
for "<i>Attention</i>." This signal can also be made with a blanket,
properly
grasped so as to form a long narrow roll. Perhaps this signal would
more properly belong under "<i>Caution</i>," as it would be used to denote
the presence of a dangerous beast or snake, and not that of a human
enemy. (<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/fig337.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig337.png" alt="Buffalo discovered. Dakota" /></a>Fig. 337.&mdash;Signal for "buffalo discovered."</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/fig338.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig338.png" alt="Discovery. Dakota" /></a>Fig. 338.&mdash;Signal of discovery or alarm.</div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page533" id="page533"></a>[pg 533]</span>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Passing and repassing one another, either on foot or mounted,
is used as a war-signal; which is expressed in the
Hidatsa&mdash;makimak&#259;'da&mdash;halidi&#233;. (<i>Mandan and Hidatsa</i> I.)</p>

<h5>DIRECTION.</h5>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Pass around that place.</p>

<p>Point the folded blanket in the direction of the object or place to be
avoided, then draw it near the body, and wave it rapidly several times
in front of the body only, and then throwing it out toward the side on
which you wish the person to approach you, and repeat a sufficient
number of times for the signal to be understood. (<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<h5>DISCOVERY.</h5>

<p>The discovery of enemies, game, or anything else, is announced by
riding rapidly to and fro, or in a circle. The idea that there is a
difference
in the signification of these two directions of riding appears, according
to many of the Dakota Indians of the Missouri Valley, to be erroneous.
Parties away from their regular encampment are generally in
search of some special object, such as game, or of another party, either
friendly or hostile, which is, generally understood, and when that object
is found, the announcement is made to their companions in either of
the above ways. The reason that a horseman may ride from side to
side is, that the party to whom he desires to communicate may be at a
particular locality, and his movement&mdash;at right angles to the direction
to the party&mdash;would be perfectly clear. Should the party be separated
into smaller bands, or have flankers or scouts at various points, the
only way in which the rider's signal could be recognized as a motion
from side to side, by all the persons to whom the signal was directed,
would be for him to ride in a circle, which he naturally does.
(<i>Dakota</i> VI, VII, VIII.) Fig. 338.</p>

<p>The latter was noticed by Dr. Hoffman in 1873, on the Yellowstone
River, while attached to the Stanley Expedition. The Indians had
again concentrated after their first repulse by General Custer, and taken
possession of the woods and bluffs on the opposite side of the river.
As the column came up, one Indian was seen upon a high bluff to ride
rapidly round in a circle, occasionally firing off his revolver. The signal
announced the discovery of the advancing force, which had been expected,
and he could be distinctly seen from the surrounding region. As
many of the enemy were still scattered over the neighborhood, some of
them would not have been able to recognize this signal had he ridden
to and from an observer, but the circle produced a lateral movement
visible from any point.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page534" id="page534"></a>[pg 534]</span>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Of enemies, or other game than Buffalo. See also <span class="sc">Notes on Cheyenne and Arapaho signals</span>.</p>

<p>The discovery of enemies is indicated by riding rapidly around in a
circle, so that the signal could be seen by their friends, but out of sight
of the discovered enemy. (<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<p>When enemies are discovered, or other game than buffalo, the sentinel
waves his blanket over his head up and down, holding an end in
each hand. (<i>Omaha</i> I; <i>Ponka</i> I.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Of game, wood, water, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This is communicated by riding rapidly forward and backward on the
top of the highest hill. The same would be communicated with a blanket
by waving it right and left, and then directly toward the game or whatever
the party might be searching for, indicating that it is not to the right or
to the left, but directly in front. (<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<h5>DRILL, MILITARY.</h5>

<p>"It is done by signals, devised after a system of the Indian's own
invention, and communicated in various ways.</p>

<p>"Wonderful as the statement may appear, the signaling on a bright
day, when the sun is in the proper direction, is done with a piece of
looking-glass held in the hollow of the hand. The reflection of the
sun's rays thrown on the ranks communicates in some mysterious way
the wishes of the chief. Once standing on a little knoll overlooking
the valley of the South Platte, I witnessed almost at my feet a drill of
about one hundred warriors by a Sioux chief, who sat on his horse on a
knoll opposite me, and about two hundred yards from his command in
the plain below. For more than half an hour he commanded a drill,
which for variety and promptness of action could not be equaled by
any civilized cavalry of the world. All I could see was an occasional
movement of the right arm. He himself afterwards told me that he
used a looking-glass." (Dodge's <i>Plains of the Great West</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>,
pp. 307, 308.)</p>

<h5>FRIENDSHIP.</h5>

<p>If two Indians [of the plains] are approaching one another on horseback,
and they may, for instance, be one mile apart, or as far as they
can see each other. At that safe distance one wants to indicate to the
other that he wishes to be friendly. He does this by turning his horse
around and traveling about fifty paces back and forth, repeating this
two or three times; this shows to the other Indian that he is not for
hostility, but for friendly relations. If the second Indian accepts this
proffered overture of friendship, he indicates the same by locking the
fingers of both hands as far as to the first joints, and in that position
raises his hands and lets them rest on his forehead with the palms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page535" id="page535"></a>[pg 535]</span>
either in or out, indifferently, as if he were trying to shield his eyes
from the excessive light of the sun. This implies, "I, too, am for
peace," or "I accept your overture." (<i>Sac, Fox, and Kickapoo</i> I.) It
is interesting in this connection to note the reception of Father Marquette
by an Illinois chief who is reported to have raised his hands to his eyes
as if to shield them from overpowering splendor. That action was supposed
to be made in a combination of humility and admiration, and a
pretended inability to gaze on the face of the illustrious guest has been
taken to be the conception of the gesture, which in fact was probably
only the holding the interlocked hands in the most demonstrative posture.
An oriental gesture in which the flat hand is actually interposed
as a shield to the eyes before a superior is probably made with the
poetical conception erroneously attributed to the Indian.</p>

<p>The display of green branches to signalize friendly or pacific intentions
does not appear to have been noticed among the North American
Indians by trustworthy observers. Captain Cook makes frequent
mention of it as the ceremonial greeting among islands he visited. See
his <i>Voyage toward the South Pole. London</i>, 1784, Vol. II, pp. 30 and
35.
Green branches were also waved, in signal of <i>friendship</i> by the
natives
of the island of New Britain to the members of the expedition in charge
of Mr. Wilfred Powell in 1878. <i>Proceedings of the Royal Geological
Society</i>, February, 1881, p. 89.</p>

<h5>HALT!</h5>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; Stand there! he is coming this way.</p>

<p>Grasp the end of the blanket or robe; wave it downward several
times. (<i>Omaha</i> I.)</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; To inquire disposition.</p>

<p>Wave the folded blanket to the right and left in front of the body,
then point toward the person or persons approaching, and carry it from
a horizontal position in front of the body rapidly downward and upward
several times. (<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<h5>MANY.</h5>

<p>Wave the blanket directly in front of the body upward and downward
several times. Many of <i>anything</i>. (<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<h5>PEACE, COUPLED WITH INVITATION.</h5>

<p>Motion of spreading a real or imaginary robe or skin on the ground.
Noticed by Lewis and Clark on their first meeting with the Shoshoni in
1805. (<i>Lewis and Clark's Travels</i>, &amp;c., London, 1817, vol. ii, p.
74.) This
signal is more particularly described as follows: Grasp the blanket by
the two corners with the hands, throw it above the head, allowing it to
unfold as it falls to the ground as if in the act of spreading it.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page536" id="page536"></a>[pg 536]</span>

<h5>QUESTION.</h5>

<p>The ordinary manner of opening communication with parties known
or supposed to be hostile is to ride toward them in zigzag manner, or to
ride in a circle. (Custer's <i>My Life on the Plains</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, p.
58.)</p>

<p>This author mentions (p. 202) a systematic manner of waving a blanket,
by which the son of Satana, the Kaiowa chief, conveyed information to
him, and a similar performance by Yellow Bear, a chief of the Arapahos
(p. 219), neither of which he explains in detail.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; I do not know you. Who are you?</p>

<p>Point the folded blanket at arm's length toward the person, and then
wave it toward the right and left in front of the face. You&mdash;I don't
know. Take an end of the blanket in each hand, and extend the arms
to full capacity at the sides of the body, letting the other ends hang
down in front of the body to the ground, means, Where do you come
from? or who are you? (<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<h5>SAFETY. ALL QUIET. See <span class="sc">Notes on Cheyenne and Arapaho signals</span>.</h5>

<h5>SURRENDER.</h5>

<p>Hold the folded blanket or a piece of cloth high above the head.
"This really means 'I want to die right now.'" (<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<h5>SURROUNDED, We are.</h5>

<p>Take an end of the blanket in each hand, extend the arms at the sides
of the body, allowing the blanket to hang down in front of the body,
and then wave it in a circular manner. (<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>




<h2>SIGNALS MADE WHEN THE PERSON OF THE SIGNALIST IS NOT VISIBLE.</h2>

<h3><i>SMOKE SIGNALS GENERALLY.</i></h3>

<p>They [the Indians] had abandoned the coast, along which bale-fires
were left burning and sending up their columns of smoke to advise the
distant bands of the arrival of their old enemy. (Schoolcraft's
<i>History</i>,
&amp;c., vol. iii, p. 35, giving a condensed account of De Soto's expedition.)</p>

<p>"Their systems of telegraphs are very peculiar, and though they
might seem impracticable at first, yet so thoroughly are they understood
by the savages that it is availed of frequently to immense advantage.
The most remarkable is by raising smokes, by which many important
facts are communicated to a considerable distance and made intelligible
by the manner, size, number, or repetition of the smokes, which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page537" id="page537"></a>[pg 537]</span>
commonly raised by firing spots of dry grass." (Josiah Gregg's <i>Commerce
of the Prairies</i>. <i>New York</i>, 1844, vol. ii, p. 286.)</p>

<p>The highest elevations of land are selected as stations from which
signals with smoke are made. These can be seen at a distance of from
twenty to fifty miles. By varying the number of columns of smoke different
meanings are conveyed. The most simple as well as the most
varied mode, and resembling the telegraphic alphabet, is arranged by
building a small fire, which is not allowed to blaze; then by placing an
armful of partially green grass or weeds over the fire, as if to smother
it, a dense white smoke is created, which ordinarily will ascend in a
continuous vertical column for hundreds of feet. Having established a
current of smoke, the Indian simply takes his blanket and by spreading it
over the small pile of weeds or grass from which the smoke takes its
source, and properly controlling the edges and corners of the blanket, he
confines the smoke, and is in this way able to retain it for several
moments. By rapidly displacing the blanket, the operator is enabled to
cause a dense volume of smoke to rise, the length or shortness of
which, as well as the number and frequency of the columns, he can regulate
perfectly, simply by a proper use of the blanket. (Custer's <i>My life on
the Plains</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 187.)</p>

<p>They gathered an armful of dried grass and weeds, which were placed
and carried upon the highest point of the peak, where, everything being in
readiness, the match was applied close to the ground; but the blaze was no
sooner well lighted and about to envelop the entire amount of grass
collected than it was smothered with the unlighted portion. A slender
column of gray smoke then began to ascend in a perpendicular column. This
was not enough, as it might be taken for the smoke rising from a simple
camp-fire. The smoldering grass was then covered with a blanket, the corners
of which were held so closely to the ground as to almost completely confine
and cut off the column of smoke. Waiting a few moments, until the smoke was
beginning to escape from beneath, the blanket was suddenly thrown aside,
when a beautiful balloon-shaped column puffed up ward like the white cloud
of smoke which attends the discharge of a
field-piece. Again casting the blanket on the pile of grass, the
column was interrupted as before, and again in due time released, so that a
succession of elongated, egg-shaped puffs of smoke kept ascending toward
the sky in the most regular manner. This bead-like column of smoke,
considering the height from which it began to ascend, was visible from
points on the level plain fifty miles distant. (<i>Ib.</i>, p. 217.)</p>

<p>The following extracts are made from Fremont's <i>First and Second
Expeditions</i>, 1842-3-4, Ex. Doc., 28th Cong. 2d Session, Senate,
Washington, 1845:</p>

<p>"Columns of smoke rose over the country at scattered intervals&mdash;signals
by which the Indians here, as elsewhere, communicate to each other
that enemies are in the country," p. 220. This was January 18, 1844, in
the vicinity of Pyramid Lake, and perhaps the signalists were Pai-Utes.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page538" id="page538"></a>[pg 538]</span>

<p>"While we were speaking, a smoke rose suddenly from the cottonwood
grove below, which plainly told us what had befallen him [Tabeau];
it was raised to inform the surrounding Indians that a blow had been
struck, and to tell them to be on their guard," p. 268, 269. This was on
May 5, 1844, near the Rio Virgen, Utah, and was narrated of "Diggers,"
probably Chemehuevas.</p>

<h5>ARRIVAL OF A PARTY AT AN APPOINTED PLACE, WHEN ALL IS SAFE.</h5>

<p>This is made by sending upward one column of smoke from, a fire
partially smothered by green grass. This is only used by previous
agreement, and if seen by friends of the party, the signal is answered
in the same manner. But should either party discover the presence of
enemies, no signal would be made, but the fact would be communicated
by a runner. (<i>Dakota</i> I.)</p>

<h5>SUCCESS OF A WAR PARTY.</h5>

<p>Whenever a war party, consisting of either Pima, Papago, or Maricopa
Indians, returned from an expedition into the Apache country,
their success was announced from the first and most distant elevation
visible from their settlements. The number of scalps secured was shown
by a corresponding number of columns of smoke, arranged in a horizontal
line, side by side, so as to be distinguishable by the observers.
When the returning party was unsuccessful, no such signals were made.
(<i>Pima and Papago</i> I.) Fig. 339. A similar custom appears to have
existed among the Ponkas, although the custom has apparently been discontinued
by them, as shown in the following proper name: C&#250;-de g&#225;-xe,
Smoke maker: He who made a smoke by burning grass returning from war.</p>



<h3><i>SMOKE SIGNALS OF THE APACHES.</i></h3>

<p>The following information was obtained by Dr. <span class="sc">W.J. Hoffman</span>
from the Apache chiefs named on page <a href="#page407">407</a>, under the title of <span class="sc">Tinnean</span>,
(<i>Apache</i> I):</p>

<p>The materials used in making smoke of sufficient density and color
consist of pine or cedar boughs, leaves and grass, which can nearly
always be obtained in the regions occupied by the Apaches of Northern
New Mexico. These Indians state that they employ but three kinds of
signals, each of which consists of columns of smoke, numbering from one
to three or more.</p>

<h5>ALARM.</h5>

<p>This signal is made by causing three or more columns of smoke to
ascend, and signifies danger or the approach of an enemy, and also
requires the concentration of those who see them. These signals are
communicated from one camp to another, and the most distant bands
are guided by their location. The greater the haste desired the greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page539" id="page539"></a>[pg 539]</span>
the number of columns of smoke. These are often so hastily made that
they may resemble puffs of smoke, and are caused by throwing heaps
of grass and leaves upon the embers again and again.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%;"><a href="images/fig339.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig339.png" alt="Success of war party. Pima" /></a>Fig. 339.&mdash;Signal of successful war-party.</div>

<h5>ATTENTION.</h5>

<p>This signal is generally made by producing one continuous column,
and signifies attention for several purposes, viz, when a band had become
tired of one locality, or the grass may have been consumed by the ponies,
or some other cause necessitated removal, or should an enemy be
reported, which would require farther watching before a decision as to
future action would be made. The intention or knowledge of anything
unusual would be communicated to neighboring bands by causing one
column of smoke to ascend.</p>

<h5>ESTABLISHMENT OF A CAMP; QUIET; SAFETY.</h5>

<p>When a removal of camp has been made, after the signal for <span class="sc">Attention</span>
has been given, and the party have selected a place where they
propose to remain until there may be a necessity or desire for their
removal, two columns of smoke are made, to inform their friends that
they propose to remain at that place. Two columns are also made at
other times during a long continued residence, to inform the neighboring
bands that a camp still exists, and that all is favorable and quiet.</p>



<h3><i>FOREIGN SMOKE SIGNALS.</i></h3>

<p>The following examples of smoke signals in foreign lands are added for
comparison.</p>

<p>Miss Haigh, speaking of the Guanches of the Canary Islands at the
time of the Spanish conquest, says: "When an enemy approached,
they alarmed the country by raising a thick smoke or by whistling,
which was repeated from one to another. This latter method is still in
use among the people of Teneriffe, and may be heard at an almost incredible
distance." (<i>Trans. Eth. Soc. Lond. vii</i>, 1869, sec. ser., pp. 109,
110.)</p>

<p>"The natives have an easy method of telegraphing news to their distant
friends. When Sir Thomas Mitchell was traveling through Eastern
Australia he often saw columns of smoke ascending through the trees
in the forests, and he soon learned that the natives used the smoke of
fires for the purpose of making known his movements to their friends.
Near Mount Frazer he observed a dense column of smoke, and subsequently
other smokes arose, extending in a telegraphic line far to the
south, along the base of the mountains, and thus communicating to the
natives who might be upon his route homeward the tidings of his return.</p>

<p>"When Sir Thomas reached Portland Bay he noticed that when a whale
appeared in the bay the natives were accustomed to send up a column
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page540" id="page540"></a>[pg 540]</span>
of smoke, thus giving timely intimation to all the whalers. If the whale
should be pursued by one boat's crew only it might be taken; but if
pursued by several, it would probably be run ashore and become food
for the blacks." (Smyth, <i>loc. cit.</i>, vol. 1, pp. 152, 153, quoting
Maj. T.L. Mitchell's <i>Eastern Australia</i>, vol. ii, p. 241.)</p>

<p>Jardine, writing of the natives of Cape York, says that a "communication
between the islanders and the natives of the mainland is frequent;
and the rapid manner in which news is carried from tribe to tribe, to
great distances, is astonishing. I was informed of the approach of Her
Majesty's Steamer Salamander, on her last visit, two days before her
arrival here. Intelligence is conveyed by means of fires made to throw
up smoke in different forms, and by messengers who perform long and
rapid journeys." (Smyth, <i>loc. cit.</i>, vol. 1, p. 153, quoting from
<i>Overland Expedition</i>, p. 85.)</p>

<p>Messengers in all parts of Australia appear to have used this mode of
signaling. In Victoria, when traveling through the forests, they were
accustomed to raise smoke by filling the hollow of a tree with green
boughs and setting fire to the trunk at its base; and in this way, as they
always selected an elevated position for the fire when they could, their
movements were made known.</p>

<p>When engaged in hunting, when traveling on secret expeditions,
when approaching an encampment, when threatened with danger, or
when foes menaced their friends, the natives made signals by raising a
smoke. And their fires were lighted in such a way as to give forth
signals that would be understood by people of their own tribe and by
friendly tribes. They exhibited great ability in managing their system
of telegraphy; and in former times it was not seldom used to the injury
of the white settlers, who at first had no idea that the thin column of
smoke rising through the foliage of the adjacent bush, and raised perhaps
by some feeble old woman, was an intimation to the warriors to
advance and attack the Europeans. (R. Brough Smyth, F.L.S., F.G.S.,
<i>The Aborigines of Victoria</i>. <i>Melbourne</i>, 1878, vol. i, pp. 152,
153.)</p>



<h3><i>FIRE ARROWS.</i></h3>

<p>"Travelers on the prairie have often seen the Indians throwing up
signal lights at night, and have wondered how it was done.... They
take off the head of the arrow and dip the shaft in gunpowder,
mixed with glue.... The gunpowder adheres to the wood, and
coats it three or four inches from its end to the depth of one-fourth of
an inch. Chewed bark mixed with dry gunpowder is then fastened to
the stick, and the arrow is ready for use. When it is to be fired, a
warrior places it on his bowstring and draws his bow ready to let it
fly; the point of the arrow is then lowered, another warrior lights the
dry bark, and it is shot high in the air. When it has gone up a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page541" id="page541"></a>[pg 541]</span>
distance, it bursts out into a flame, and burns brightly until it falls to
the ground. Various meanings are attached to these fire-arrow signals.
Thus, one arrow meant, among the Santees, 'The enemy are about';
two arrows from the same point, 'Danger'; three, 'Great danger';
many, 'They are too strong, or we are falling back'; two arrows sent
up at the same moment, 'We will attack'; three, 'Soon'; four, 'Now';
if shot diagonally, 'In that direction.' These signals are constantly
changed, and are always agreed upon when the party goes out or before
it separates. The Indians send their signals very intelligently, and
seldom make mistakes in telegraphing each other by these silent monitors.
The amount of information they can communicate by fires and burning
arrows is perfectly wonderful. Every war party carries with it bundles
of signal arrows." (<i>Belden, The White Chief; or Twelve Years among the
Wild Indians of the Plains</i>. <i>Cincinnati and New York</i>, 1871, pp. 106,
107.)</p>

<p>With regard to the above, it is possible that white influence has been
felt in the mode of signaling as well as in the use of gunpowder, but
it would be interesting to learn if any Indians adopted a similar expedient
before gunpowder was known to them. They frequently used arrows,
to which flaming material was attached, to set fire to the wooden houses
of the early colonists. The Caribs were acquainted with this same mode
of destruction as appears by the following quotation:</p>

<p>"Their arrows were commonly poisoned, except when they made their
military excursions by night; on these occasions they converted them
into instruments of still greater mischief; for, by arming the points
with pledgets of cotton dipped in oil, and set on fire, they fired whole
villages of their enemies at a distance." (<i>Alcedo. The Geograph. and
Hist. Dict. of America and the West Indies</i>. Thompson's trans.
<i>London</i>, 1812, Vol. I, p. 314.)</p>



<h3><i>DUST SIGNALS.</i></h3>

<p>When an enemy, game, or anything else which was the special object
of search is discovered, handfulls of dust are thrown into the air to
announce that discovery. This signal has the same general signification
as when riding to and fro, or, round in a circle on an elevated portion of
ground, or a bluff. (<i>Dakota</i> VII, VII.)</p>

<p>When any game or any enemy is discovered, and should the sentinel
be without a blanket, he throws a handful of dust up into the air. When
the Brul&#233;s attacked the Ponkas, in 1872, they stood on the bluff and
threw up dust. (<i>Omaha</i> I; <i>Ponka</i> I.)</p>

<p>There appears to be among the Bushmen a custom of throwing up
sand or earth into the air when at a distance from home and in need of
help of some kind from those who were there. (<i>Miss L.C. Lloyd, MS.
Letter</i>, dated July 10, 1880, from Charlton House, Mowbray, near Cape
Town, Africa.)</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page542" id="page542"></a>[pg 542]</span>



<h3><i>NOTES ON CHEYENNE AND ARAPAHO SIGNALS.</i></h3>

<p>The following information was obtained from <span class="sc">Wa-u</span><sup>n</sup>'(<i>Bobtail</i>),
<span class="sc">Mo-hi'-nuk'-ma-ha'-it</span>
(<i>Big horse</i>), Cheyennes, and <span class="sc">O-qo-his'-sa</span> (<i>The Mare</i>, better
known as "Little Raven"), and <span class="sc">Na'-watc</span> (<i>Left Hand</i>), Arapahos, chiefs
and members of a delegation who visited Washington, D.C., in September,
1880, in the interest of their tribes dwelling in Indian Territory:</p>

<p>A party of Indians going on the war-path leave camp, announcing
their project to the remaining individuals and informing neighboring
friends by sending runners. A party is not systematically organized
until several days away from its headquarters, unless circumstances
should require immediate action. The pipe-bearers are appointed, who
precede the party while on the march, carrying the pipes, and no one is
allowed to cross ahead of these individuals, or to join the party by riding
up before the head of the column, as it would endanger the success of the
expedition. All new arrivals fall in from either side or the rear. Upon
coming in sight of any elevations of land likely to afford a good view of
the surrounding country the warriors come to a halt and secrete themselves
as much as possible. The scouts who have already been selected, advance
just before daybreak to within a moderate distance of the elevation to
ascertain if any of the enemy has preceded them. This is only discovered by
carefully watching the summit to see if any objects are in motion; if not,
the flight of birds is observed, and if any should alight upon the hill or
butte it would indicate the absence of anything that might ordinarily scare
them away. Should a large bird, as a raven, crow, or eagle, fly toward the
hill-top and make a sudden swerve to either side and disappear, it would
indicate the presence of something sufficient to require further
examination. When it is learned that there is reason to suspect an enemy
the scout, who has all the time been closely watched by the party in the
rear, makes a signal for them to lie
still, signifying <i>danger or caution.</i> It is made by grasping the
blanket
with the right hand and waving it earthward from a position in front of and
as high as the shoulder. This is nearly the same as civilized Americans use
the hand for a similar purpose in battle or hunting to direct "lie quiet"!</p>

<p>Should the hill, however, be clear of any one, the Indian will ascend
slowly, and under cover as much as possible, and gain a view of the
country. If there is no one to be seen, the blanket is grasped and waved
horizontally from right to left and back again repeatedly, showing a clear
surface. If the enemy is discovered, the scout will give the <i>alarm</i>
by running down the hill, upon a side visible to the watchers, in a zigzag
manner, which communicates the state of affairs.</p>

<p>Should any expedition or advance be attempted at night, the same
signals as are made with the blanket are made with a firebrand, which
is constructed of a bunch of grass tied to a short pole.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page543" id="page543"></a>[pg 543]</span>

<p>When a war party encamps for a night or a day or more, a piece of
wood is stuck into the ground, pointing in the direction pursued, with
a number of cuts, notches, or marks corresponding to the number of
days which the party spent after leaving the last camp until leaving the
present camp, serving to show to the recruits to the main party the
course to be followed, and the distance.</p>

<p>A hunting party in advancing takes the same precautions as a war
party, so as not to be surprised by an enemy. If a scout ascends a
prominent elevation and discovers no game, the blanket is grasped and
waved horizontally from side to side at the height of the shoulders or
head; and if game is discovered the Indian rides back and forth (from
left to right) a short distance so that the distant observers can view the
maneuver. If a large herd of buffalo is found, the extent traveled over
in going to and fro increases in proportion to the size of the herd. A
quicker gait is traveled when the herd is very large or haste on the part
of the hunters is desired.</p>

<p>It is stated that these Indians also use mirrors to signal from one
elevation to another, but the system could not be learned, as they say
they have no longer use for it, having ceased warfare(?).</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page544" id="page544"></a>[pg 544]</span>

<h2>SCHEME OF ILLUSTRATION.</h2>

<p>In the following pages the scheme of graphic illustration, intended
both to save labor and secure accuracy, which was presented in the
<i>Introduction
to the Study of Sign Language</i>, is reproduced with some improvements.
It is given for the use of observers who may not see that publication,
the material parts of which being included in the present paper
it is not necessary that the former should now be furnished. The <span class="sc">Types
of Hand Positions</span> were prepared for reference by the corresponding
letters of the alphabet to avoid tedious description, should any of them
exactly correspond, or by alteration, as suggested in the note following
them. These, as well as the <span class="sc">Outlines of Arm Positions</span>, giving
front and side outline's with arms pendant, were distributed in separate
sheets to observers for their convenience in recording, and this will still
be cheerfully done when request is made to the present writer. When
the sheets are not accessible the <span class="sc">Types</span> can be used for graphic changes by
tracing the one selected, or by a few words indicating the change, as shown
in the <span class="sc">Examples</span>. The <span class="sc">Outlines of Arm Positions</span> can also be readily traced
for the same use as if the sheets had been provided. It is hoped that this
scheme, promoting uniformity in description and illustration, will be
adopted by all observers who cannot be specially addressed.</p>

<p>Collaborators in the gestures of foreign uncivilized peoples will confer
a favor by sending at least one photograph or sketch in native costume
of a typical individual of the tribe, the gestures of which are reported
upon, in order that it may be reproduced in the complete work. Such
photograph or sketch need not be made in the execution of any particular
gesture, which can be done by artists engaged on the work, but
would be still more acceptable if it could be so made.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page545" id="page545"></a>[pg 545]</span>

<h2>OUTLINES FOR ARM POSITIONS IN SIGN LANGUAGE.</h2>

<div class="figright" style="width:25%;"><a href="images/fig341.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig341.png" alt="Outline for arm positions, profile" /></a>Fig. 341.</div>

<div class="figrightno" style="width:30%;"><a href="images/fig340.png"><img width="100%" src="images/fig340.png" alt="Outline for arm positions, full face" /></a>Fig. 340.</div>

<p>The gestures, to be indicated by corrected positions of arms and
by dotted lines showing the motion from the initial to the final positions
(which, are severally marked by an arrow-head and a cross&mdash;see
<span class="sc">Examples</span>), will always be shown as they appear to an observer
facing the gesturer, the
front outline, Fig. 340, or side,
Fig. 341, or both, being used as
most convenient. The special positions
of hands and fingers will be
designated by reference to the
<span class="sc">Types of Hand Positions</span>. For
brevity in the written description,
"hand" may be used for "right
hand," when that one alone is employed
in any particular gesture.
When more convenient to use the
profile figure in which the right
arm is exhibited for a gesture actually
made by the left hand and
arm it can be done, the fact, however,
being noted.</p>

<p>In cases where the conception or origin of any sign is ascertained or
suggested it should be annexed to the description, and when obtained
from the gesturer will be so stated affirmatively, otherwise it will be
considered
to be presented by the observer. The graphic illustration of
associated facial expression or bodily posture which may accentuate or
qualify a gesture is necessarily left to the ingenuity of the contributor.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page546" id="page546"></a>[pg 546]</span>


<h4><i>ORDER OF ARRANGEMENT</i>.</h4>

<p>The following order of arrangement for written descriptions is suggested.
The use of a separate sheet or part sheet of paper for each
sign described and illustrated would be convenient in the collation. It
should always be affirmatively stated whether the "conception or origin"
of the sign was procured from the sign-maker, or is suggested or inferred
by the observer.</p>

<h4>NOTE CONCERNING THE FOREGOING TYPES.</h4>

<p>The positions are given as they appear to an observer facing the
gesturer, and are designed to show the relations of the fingers to the
hand rather than the positions of the hand relative to the body, which
must be shown by the outlines (see <span class="sc">Outlines of Arm Positions</span>) or
description. The right and left hands are figured above without
discrimination, but in description or reference the right hand will be
understood when the left is not specified. The hands as figured can
also with proper intimation be applied with changes either upward,
downward, or inclined to either side, so long as the relative positions
of the fingers are retained, and when in that respect no one of the types
exactly corresponds with a sign observed, modifications may be made by
pen or pencil on that one of the types, or a tracing of it, found most
convenient, as indicated in the <span class="sc">Examples</span>, and referred to by the letter
of the alphabet under the type changed, with the addition of a
numeral&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>,
A 1, and if that type, <i>i.e.</i>, A, were changed a second time by
the observer (which change would necessarily be drawn on another
sheet of types or another tracing of a type selected when there are no
sheets provided), it should be referred to as A 2.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
